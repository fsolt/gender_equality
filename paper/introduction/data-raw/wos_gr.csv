We test the hypothesis that traditional agricultural practices influenced the historical gender division of labor and the evolution of gender norms. We find that, consistent with existing hypotheses, the descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture today have less equal gender norms, measured using reported gender-role attitudes and female participation in the workplace, politics, and entrepreneurial activities. Our results hold looking across countries, across districts within countries, and across ethnicities within districts. To test for the importance of cultural persistence, we examine the children of immigrants living in Europe and the United States. We find that even among these individuals, all born and raised in the same country, those with a heritage of traditional plough use exhibit less equal beliefs about gender roles today.

A decomposition analysis suggested that offsetting trends affected marital quality. Increases in marital heterogamy, premarital cohabitation, wives' extended hours of employment, and wives' job demands were associated with declines in multiple dimensions of marital quality. In contrast, increases in economic resources, decision-making equality, nontraditional attitudes toward gender, and support for the norm of lifelong marriage were associated with improvements in multiple dimensions of marital quality.

Data from 16 nations showed that this pattern did not generalize to all nations. The magnitude and direction of the sex difference was highly correlated with national-level variations in gender empowerment and individualism-collectivism. As gender equality and individualism increased, the sex difference in partner violence moved in the direction of lesser female victimization and greater male victimization. A second analysis of 52 nations showed that 3 indexes of women's victimization were also inversely correlated with gender equality and individualism. Sexist attitudes and relative approval of wife beating were also associated with women's victimization rates, but general levels of violent crime were not. The findings are discussed in terms of a social role approach to variations in sex differences between cultures.","Univ Cent Lancashire, Dept Psychol, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Archer, J (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Dept Psychol, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",jarcher@uclan.ac.uk,,,,,,,120,256,307,2,56,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1088-8683,,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV,Pers.

A Macro-Level Analysis,EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EQUITY; FAMILY; DIVISION; POLICY; RATES,"This study explores whether the diffusion of gender-equitable attitudes towards female employment is associated with fertility. We argue that any positive effect on fertility requires not only high levels of gender-equitable attitudes overall, but also attitude convergence between men and women. We analyse 27 countries using data from the World Values Surveys and European Values Studies. We find support for a U-shaped relationship between changes in gender role attitudes and fertility: an initial drop in fertility is observed as countries move from a traditional to a more gender-symmetric model. Beyond a certain threshold, additional increases in gender egalitarianism become positively associated with fertility. This curvi-linear relationship is moderated by the difference in attitudes between men and women: when there is more agreement, changes are more rapid and the effect of gender egalitarian attitudes on fertility strengthens.","[Arpino, Bruno; Esping-Andersen, Gosta; Pessin, Lea] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Arpino, B (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",bruno.arpino@upf.edu,"Arpino, Bruno/AAF-3867-2019; Pessin, Lea/B-5516-2015; Esping-Andersen, Gosta/G-2765-2014","Pessin, Lea/0000-0002-1665-2527; Arpino, Bruno/0000-0002-8374-3066; Esping-Andersen, Gosta/0000-0001-5645-6750",European Research Council under the European Union [269387]; European Research Council (ERC) [269387] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),Gosta Esping-Andersen gratefully acknowledges financial support from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme through the advanced grant FP7-IDEAS-ERC/no269387 'Family Polarization'.,,35,109,119,8,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,,EUR SOCIOL REV,Eur.

Using the 2016 Australian Election Study, this paper proposes to test support for different measures aiming to increasing women's representation in Australian politics. More specifically, I investigate the role of partisanship in explaining gender differences in support for gender quotas. I find that differences in support for quotas are greater among women, and among men, than between women and men. The paper also demonstrates that the role of political values in explaining differences in support for gender quotas is non-uniform. Indeed, attitudes towards government intervention, minority rights, and gender equality are more crucial in explaining differences in support for legislative quotas among men than among women.","[Beauregard, Katrine] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Acton, Australia",Australian National University,"Beauregard, K (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Acton, Australia.",katrine.beauregard@anu.edu.au,"Beauregard, Katrine/AAH-4696-2020","Beauregard, Katrine/0000-0002-0861-6219",,,,,47,29,30,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1036-1146,1363-030X,,AUST J POLIT SCI,Aust.

We argue the role of attitudes toward women in understanding support for policies aiming to increase the presence of women in politics is ambivalent-both hostile and benevolent forms of sexism contribute in understanding support, albeit in different ways. Using original data from a survey conducted on a probability-based sample of Australian respondents, our findings demonstrate that hostile sexists are more likely to oppose increasing of women's presence in politics through the adoption of gender quotas. Benevolent sexists, on the other hand, are more likely to support these policies than respondents exhibiting low levels of benevolent sexism. We argue this is because benevolent sexism holds that women are pure and need protection; they do not have what it takes to succeed in politics without the assistance of quotas. Finally, we show that while women are more likely to support quotas, ambivalent sexism has the same relationship with support among both women and men. These findings suggest that aggregate levels of public support for gender quotas do not necessarily represent greater acceptance of gender equality generally.","[Beauregard, Katrine; Sheppard, Jill] Australian Natl Univ, Acton, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Beauregard, K (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, RSSS Bldg,Bldg 146, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",katrine.beauregard@anu.edu.au,"Beauregard, Katrine/AAH-4696-2020","Beauregard, Katrine/0000-0002-0861-6219; Sheppard, Jill/0000-0002-9150-2780",,,,,69,23,25,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0162-895X,1467-9221,,POLIT PSYCHOL,Polit.

Two studies including a randomized double-blind experiment demonstrate that biases persist even when women become well represented (evinced in veterinary medicine). Evidence included managers evaluating an employee randomly assigned a male (versus female) name as more competent and advising a $3475.00 higher salary, equating to an 8% pay gap. Importantly, those who thought bias was not happening in their field were the key drivers of it-a high risk group (including men and women) that, as shown, can be readily identified/assessed.

Results show that (1) gay men are disliked more than lesbian women across all countries; (2) after adjusting for endorsement of traditional gender norms, the relationship between participant gender and sexual prejudice is inconsistent across Western countries, but men (vs. women) in non-Western countries consistently report more negative attitudes toward gay men; and (3) a significant association between gender norm endorsement and sexual prejudice across countries, but it was absent or reversed in China, India, and South Korea. Taken together, this work suggests that gender and sexuality may be more loosely associated in some non-Western contexts.","[Bettinsoli, Maria Laura; Suppes, Alexandra; Napier, Jaime L.] New York Univ, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, Saadiyat Island, U Arab Emirates",,"Bettinsoli, ML (corresponding author), New York Univ, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, Saadiyat Island, U Arab Emirates.;Bettinsoli, ML (corresponding author), POB 903, New York, NY 10276 USA.",mlaurabettinsoli@gmail.com,"Suppes, Alexandra/ABD-5394-2020; Bettinsoli, Maria Laura/ABB-6957-2020","Bettinsoli, Maria Laura/0000-0002-5860-2675",,,,,70,91,100,3,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1948-5506,1948-5514,,SOC PSYCHOL PERS SCI,Soc.

Studies have repeatedly reported that women tend to be more peaceful and less militaristic than men. This article reexamines attitudes of individuals in relation to foreign policy and pits the gender gap against the largely forgotten feminist gap. We argue that the individual-level relationship between gender equality attitudes on the one hand, and tolerance and benevolence on the other, is under-researched, but also that key contributions about the effects of feminism have been mostly ignored in research on the gender gap in public opinion. We return to the notion of a causal relationship between gender equality attitudes, and peaceful attitudes, and of a feminist gap that also exists among men. In a series of novel empirical tests, we demonstrate that attitudes to gender equality, not biological sex, explain attitudes towards other nationalities and religious groups. Using individual-level survey data from five countries around the Pacific: China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States of America, we show that both men and women who reject gender equality are much more hostile both to other nations and to minorities in their own country.","[Bjarnegard, Elin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Uppsala, Sweden; [Melander, Erik] Uppsala Univ, Dept Peace & Conflict Res, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Uppsala University,"Bjarnegård, E (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Uppsala, Sweden.",elin.bjarnegard@statsvet.uu.se,"; Melander, Erik/A-3972-2017","Bjarnegard, Elin/0000-0002-3530-2805; Melander, Erik/0000-0001-5835-0618",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [M10-0100:1]; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [M10-0100:1] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,This work was supported by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [grant number M10-0100:1].

Past accounts suggest two clusters of explanations based on interests and exposure. Using these, we examine opinions on abortion, sexual behavior, public sphere gender roles, and family responsibilities. We find that attitudes have continued to liberalize and converge with the exception of abortion attitudes. The determinants of feminist opinion vary across domains, but have been largely stable. While not identical, the predictors Of men and women's opinions are similar. The results suggest the need for more attention to the mechanisms underlying the production of feminist opinions and theoretical integration of both interests and exposure in a dynamic process.","Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Notre Dame,"Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Ballantine Hall 747,1020 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",cbolzend@indiana.edu,,"Myers, Daniel/0000-0002-0393-0110; Bolzendahl, Catherine/0000-0001-6536-7741",,,,,80,585,748,8,185,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Following the initial discovery of these trends in the 1970s, attitudes toward gender roles received less scholarly attention in the 1980s, due in large part to questions about the relevance of this type of opinion change for understanding patterns of stability and change in behaviors and institutions related to gender. Since the early 1990s, a new generation of research has reported evidence linking changing gender role attitudes to subsequent change in the behavior of individuals and also to the level of gender inequality within specific institutions. While gender role attitudes appear to have significant effects within the context of family institutions, questions about the precise causal origins of these changing attitudes have received insufficient attention in the recent literature. This paper contributes to the sociological reconsideration of this opinion trend by evaluating competing explanations of changing gender role attitudes. We find evidence of substantial cohort replacement effects. Further analyses suggest that processes of ideological learning may mediate a large portion of the cohort replacement effect, also explaining much of the contribution of adult attitude change to opinion trends. We discuss implications of these findings for advancing the literature on gender role attitudes, and also for fruitfully revisiting questions about the role of ideology in US public opinion.

Results show that the public has become more acceptant of prostitution over time. In addition, the less religious, less authoritarian, and more educated are more acceptant of prostitution than the more religious, more authoritarian, and less well educated. The effects of religiosity and authoritarianism mediate out the direct effects of age, gender, gender equality, marriage, marriage as an outdated institution, Quebec, race, and tolerance.

Tertiary sex segregation is examined across two dimensions: field of study (horizontal segregation) and tertiary level (vertical segregation). The authors argue that the different aspects of female status in higher education (e.g., overall enrollments, representation at the postgraduate level, and representation in traditionally male-dominated fields of study) do not covary because each variable is affected in distinct ways by structural and cultural features commonly associated with modernity. In particular, (1) ideals of universalism do more to undermine vertical segregation than horizontal segregation, and (2) some modem structural features may actually exacerbate specific forms of sex segregation. Consistent with these arguments, results suggest strongly integrative effects of gender-egalitarian cultural attitudes on distributions across tertiary levels, and weaker less uniform cultural effects on distributions across fields of study (one notable exception being a strong positive effect on women's representation in engineering programs). Two modem structural features-diversified tertiary systems and high rates of female employment-show segregative effects in some fields and institutional sectors. Overall, few across-the-board integrative or segregative effects can be discerned that would lend support to evolutionary conceptualizations of gender stratification. Modern cultural and structural pressures are manifested unevenly and in contextually contingent ways.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Sociol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Western Washington Univ, Dept Sociol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Western Washington University,"Charles, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Sociol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,"Charles, Maria/AAZ-7833-2020",,,,,,70,301,382,3,90,AMER SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"1307 NEW YORK AVE NW #700, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4712 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

While cohort replacement can explain about half of the increasing egalitarianism between 1974 and 1994, the changes since the mid-1990s are not well accounted for by cohort differences. Nor is the post-1994 stagnation explained by structural or broad ideological changes in American society.

Scholars argue that persistence of the gendered division of childcare is due to multiple causes, including values about gender and family, disparities in paid work, class, and social context. It is likely that all of these factors interact, but to date researchers have not explored such interactions. To address this gap, we analyze nationally representative time-use data from Australia, Denmark, France, and Italy. These countries have different employment patterns, social and family policies, and cultural attitudes toward parenting and gender equality. Using data from matched married couples, we conduct a cross-national study of mothers' and fathers' relative time in childcare, divided along dimensions of task (i.e., routine versus non-routine activities) and co-presence (i.e., caring for children together as a couple versus caring solo). Results show that mothers' and fathers' work arrangements and education relate modestly to shares of childcare, and this relationship differs across countries. We find cross-national variation in whether more equal shares result from the behavior of mothers, fathers, or both spouses. Results illustrate the relevance of social context in accentuating or minimizing the impact of individual- and household-level characteristics.","[Craig, Lyn; Mullan, Killian] Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Craig, L (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, G2 Western Campus, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",lcraig@unsw.edu.au,,"Mullan, Killian/0000-0003-0027-037X; Craig, Lyn/0000-0001-9723-7255",,,,,78,383,436,9,233,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

These settings include school, the labor market, independent living arrangements, cohabitation, marriage, and parenthood. We consider the extent to which gender and age moderate the relationships between attitudes about gender and exposure to these social contexts. Ordinary least squares regression and hazard models demonstrate that support for egalitarian roles for women and men in families is positively linked to subsequent school enrollment, women's full-time employment, and independent living, but negatively associated with the subsequent timing of entry into marriage and marital parenthood. Accumulated schooling, independent living, and full-time employment are associated with changes in individuals' attitudes about gender. Despite careful attention to gender differences, we find surprisingly little evidence that the causes and consequences of attitudes about gender differ for women and men, with the primary exception being the positive association of employment and egalitarian gender attitudes for women but not for men.

The prevalence of political gender stereotypes has almost exclusively been investigated in the United States. As the presence of these stereotypes is highly dependent on contextual factors, we switch the context and investigate whether they are also present in a List-Proportional Representation (PR) system with a high share of women in parliament spread over different parties. The results of our experimental study, conducted in Flanders (Belgium), provide evidence for the existence of stereotypical patterns. The differences in perceived issue competence are, however, rather small and not always unequivocal, but larger differences were found in terms of ideological position. This leads us to conclude that misperceptions about women's ideological orientation might be persistent and difficult to overcome. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the argument that female politicians are perceived as more leftist because they disproportionately belong to leftist parties does not hold, as female politicians are rather equally spread over the different parties in Belgium.","[Devroe, Robin; Wauters, Bram] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Devroe, R (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Robin.Devroe@UGent.be,"Devroe, Robin/P-9266-2019; Wauters, Bram/AGM-6494-2022","Devroe, Robin/0000-0002-2399-5894; Wauters, Bram/0000-0003-4216-2094",Flemish Research Foundation (FWO) [G000915N],Flemish Research Foundation (FWO)(FWO),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research for this article was financially supported by the Flemish Research Foundation (FWO), Grant G000915N.",,62,34,38,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1065-9129,1938-274X,,POLIT RES QUART,Polit.

Twelfth graders became more accepting of working mothers and equal roles for women in the workplace between the 1970s and the 2010s, with most change occurring between the 1970s and the late 1990s. Acceptance of dual-income families and fathers working half-time or not at all (stay-at-home dads) also increased. Thus, for the most part, Millennials (born 1980s-1990s) have continued trends toward more egalitarian gender roles. However, slightly more 12th graders in the 2010s (vs. the late 1990s) favored the husband as the achiever and decision maker in the family. Adults' attitudes toward working mothers became more egalitarian between the 1970s and the early 1990s, showed a small backlash in the late 1990s, and then continued the trend toward increased egalitarianism in the 2000s and 2010s. In hierarchical linear modeling analyses separating the effects of time period, generation/cohort, and age, trends were primarily due to time period with a generational peak in egalitarianism among White women Boomers (born 1946-1964). Policy makers should recognize that support for working mothers is now a solid majority position in the United States and design programs for working families accordingly.","[Donnelly, Kristin] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Twenge, Jean M.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Psychol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Clark, Malissa A.; Shaikh, Samia K.; Beiler-May, Angela; Carter, Nathan T.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; California State University System; San Diego State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Twenge, JM (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Psychol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",jtwenge@mail.sdsu.edu,"May, Angela/LFR-6930-2024; Carter, Nathan/HOC-6171-2023; Twenge, Jean/ABD-6562-2021","Clark, Malissa/0000-0001-9899-1452",,,,,47,116,170,2,90,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0361-6843,1471-6402,,PSYCHOL WOMEN QUART,Psychol.

In polls inquiring about communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g., ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative), respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men, or equally true of both. Women's relative advantage in communion increased over time, but men's relative advantage in agency showed no change. Belief in competence equality increased over time, along with belief in female superiority among those who indicated a sex difference in competence. Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial female advantage in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage.

Anti-egalitarian views are found to display the strongest negative association with female employment rates and the gender pay gap. These views are, however, softening among recent cohorts. On the other hand, perceptions of women's role as homemakers, which are likely formed in youth and linked to religious ideology, are more persistent over time. They could be implicated in the recent slowdown of the gender convergence in pay. Finally, the unavoidable clash between family values and egalitarian views, that takes the form of an inner conflict for many women-the so-called 'mother's guilt'-is another obstacle in the path towards greater gender equality in the labour market.","Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",nifortin@interchange.ubc.ca,,,,,,,53,442,516,5,114,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

However, there may be substantial numbers of Arab Muslims who do support feminist issues and who do so while being highly attached to Islam. This study explains why certain Arabs support feminism while remaining strongly religious (Muslim feminists). We propose that some Arab citizens are more likely to subvert patriarchal norms, especially in societies that construct Islam and feminism as more compatible. Empirically, we apply three-level multinomial analyses to 51 Arab Barometer and World Values Surveys, which include 57,000 Arab Muslims. Our results show that one in four Arab Muslims supports Muslim feminism-far more than those who support a more secularist version of feminism. Employed women, single people, people who distrust institutions, and more highly educated people support Muslim feminism more than do others-especially in societies that construct feminism and Islam as less contradictory, such as those with strong feminist movements. The presumption that Islam and feminism are necessarily opposed may hinder feminism.

Deviating from this Orientalist narrative, we formulate a context-dependent agentic-socialization framework, which acknowledges religiosity's and gender equality's multidimensionality along with the MENA's political-institutional diversity. We expect that religious service attendance and devotion decrease support for gender equality in politics but not in education. Moreover, we theorize that open political structures allow citizens to express agency and dissociate from dominant patriarchal patterns. We test these expectations using WVS and AB data covering 50,000 respondents in 39 MENA country-years. Our results show religious service attendance indeed reduces support for gender equality. However, more devoted citizens support gender equality in education more than the less devoted, and in more democratic polities and in polities with more freedom of press, the same is found for political gender equality. Moreover, support for gender equality is greater in open polities than closed ones, but this gap closes when people frequent religious services. These results suggest MENA citizens are not univocally passively socialized by patriarchal religious views, but actively engage with other interpretations, provided these are not banned by oppressive governments.","[Glas, Saskia; Spierings, Niels; Lubbers, Marcel; Scheepers, Peer] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Glas, S (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",s.glas@ru.nl,"Spierings, Niels/H-9812-2016; Lubbers, Marcel/C-9860-2012","Lubbers, Marcel/0000-0001-6295-6356","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO 406-16-517, 451-15-006]",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),The project was funded by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO 406-16-517 and 451-15-006).,,65,26,28,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,,EUR SOCIOL REV,Eur.

However, nuanced large-scale studies addressing which specific aspects of religiosity affect support for gender equality across the MENA are conspicuously absent. This study develops and tests a gendered agentic socialization framework that proposes that MENA citizens are not only passively socialized by religion but also have agency (within their religiosity). This disaggregates the influence of religiosity, highlights its multifacetedness, and theorizes the moderating roles that gender and sociocognitive empowerment play via gendered processes of agentic dissociations. Using 15 World Values Surveys and multilevel models, our analyses show that most dimensions of religiosity fuel opposition to gender equality. However, the salience of religion in daily life is found to increase women's support for gender equality and cushion the negative impact of religious service attendance. Also, gender and education moderate the impacts of several religiosity dimensions; for instance, women's (initially greater) support for gender equality more sharply declines with increased service attendance than men's. Altogether, this study finds that religious socialization is multifaceted and gendered, and that certain men and women are inclined and equipped to deviate from dominant patriarchal religious interpretations.","[Glas, Saskia; Spierings, Niels] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Sociol, Radboud Social & Cultural Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Scheepers, Peer] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Comparat Methodol, Radboud Social & Cultural Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Glas, S (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",s.glas@ru.nl,"Spierings, Niels/H-9812-2016; Scheepers, Peer/C-9875-2012",,NWO [406-16-517],NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This project was funded by the NWO (406-16-517).

Benevolent sexism (a subjectively favorable, chivalrous ideology that offers protection and affection to women who embrace conventional roles) coexists with hostile sexism (antipathy toward women who are viewed as usurping men's power). The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, first validated in U.S. samples, has been administered to over 15,000 men and women in 19 nations. Hostile and benevolent sexism are complementary, cross-culturally prevalent ideologies, both of which predict gender inequality. Women, as compared with men, consistently reject hostile sexism but often endorse benevolent sexism (especially in the most sexist cultures). By rewarding women for conforming to a patriarchal status quo, benevolent sexism inhibits gender equality.

Individualism/collectivism and gender egalitarianism moderated these relationships. High levels of WLB were more positively associated with job and life satisfaction for individuals in individualistic cultures, compared with individuals in collectivistic cultures.

We first discuss parental perceptions of abilities and appropriate roles for girls and boys; parental concerns about old-age support; and parental perceptions of different labor market outcomes for girls' and boys' education. We then investigate gender disparities in investments in children, children's performance at school, and children's subsequent attainment. We analyze a survey of 9-12-year-old children and their families conducted in rural Gansu Province in the year 2000, along with follow-up information about subsequent educational attainment collected 7 years later. We complement our main analysis with two illustrative case studies of rural families drawn from 11 months of fieldwork conducted in rural Gansu between 2003 and 2005 by the second author. In 2000, most mothers expressed egalitarian views about girls' and boys' rights and abilities, in the abstract. However, the vast majority of mothers still expected to rely on sons for old-age support, and nearly one in five mothers interviewed agreed with the traditional saying, Sending girls to school is useless since they will get married and leave home. Compared to boys, girls faced somewhat lower (though still very high) maternal educational expectations and a greater likelihood of being called on for household chores. However, there was little evidence of a gender gap in economic investments in education. Girls rivaled or outperformed boys in academic performance and engagement. Seven years later, boys had attained just about a third of a year more schooling than girls-a quite modest advantage that could not be fully explained by early parental attitudes and investments, or student performance or engagement. Fieldwork confirmed that parents of sons and daughters tended to have high aspirations for their children. Parents sometimes viewed boys as having greater aptitude, but tended to view girls as having more dedication-an attribute parents perceived as being critical for educational success.

The General Social Surveys include 9833 women who responded to the gender role questions with 1132 black (11.5%) and 351 Hispanic (3.6%) women. Our results refine earlier bivariate findings about the impact of specific types of life experiences and family power dynamics on women's views about appropriate roles for men and women.

Specifically, we sought to determine (1) how men and women are characterized by male and female raters, (2) how men and women characterize themselves, and (3) the degree of convergence between self-characterizations and charcterizations of one's gender group. In an experimental study, 628 U.S. male and female raters described men, women, or themselves on scales representing multiple dimensions of the two defining features of gender stereotypes, agency and communality: assertiveness, independence, instrumental competence, leadership competence (agency dimensions), and concern for others, sociability and emotional sensitivity (communality dimensions). Results indicated that stereotypes about communality persist and were equally prevalent for male and female raters, but agency characterizations were more complex. Male raters generally descibed women as being less agentic than men and as less agentic than female raters described them. However, female raters differentiated among agency dimensions and described women as less assertive than men but as equally independent and leadership competent. Both male and female raters rated men and women equally high on instrumental competence. Gender stereotypes were also evident in self-characterizations, with female raters rating themselves as less agentic than male raters and male raters rating themselves as less communal than female raters, although there were exceptions (no differences in instrumental competence, independence, and sociability self-ratings for men and women). Comparisons of self-ratings and ratings of men and women in general indicated that women tended to characterize themselves in more stereotypic terms - as less assertive and less competent in leadership - than they characterized others in their gender group. Men, in contrast, characterized themselves in less stereotypic terms -as more communal. Overall, our results show that a focus on facets of agency and communality can provide deeper insights about stereotype content than a focus on overall agency and communality.","[Hentschel, Tanja; Peus, Claudia V.] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Hentschel, Tanja] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Heilman, Madeline E.] NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA",Technical University of Munich; University of Amsterdam; New York University,"Hentschel, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Munich, Germany.;Hentschel, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.hentschel@uva.nl,,"Hentschel, Tanja/0000-0002-3037-1107",ADVANCE Diversity Science Research Grant - National Science Foundation ADVANCE-PAID award [HRD-0820202]; Research Grant Selection and Evaluation of Leaders in Business and Academia; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); European Social Fund (ESF) [FKZ 01FP1070/71]; German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM),ADVANCE Diversity Science Research Grant - National Science Foundation ADVANCE-PAID award; Research Grant Selection and Evaluation of Leaders in Business and Academia; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Social Fund (ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Technical University of Munich (TUM),This project was supported in part by an ADVANCE Diversity Science Research Grant awarded to the second author funded by the National Science Foundation ADVANCE-PAID award (HRD-0820202).

The authors argue that even weakly enforced laws can contribute to positive social change. They theorize the expressive power of VAW legislation, and present evidence for a cautiously optimistic assessment of current trends on violence against women and the ways that VAW laws affect social norms. Focusing on a time of major legal change related to VAW in Mexico, this article explores trends in behavior and attitudes related to violence by analyzing four waves of the National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relations (ENDIREH), which include detailed interviews with thousands of Mexican women. The authors find that over this period, the share of women experiencing intimate-partner abuse declined, attitudes condoning violence shifted, reporting rates rose, and most women learned about legislation to protect their rights. These changes are consistent with the authors' expectations about the expressive power of anti-violence legislation.","[Htun, Mala] Univ New Mexico, Dept Polit Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Jensenius, Francesca R.] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, Oslo, Norway; [Jensenius, Francesca R.] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Oslo, Norway",University of New Mexico; University of Oslo,"Jensenius, FR (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, Oslo, Norway.;Jensenius, FR (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Oslo, Norway.",malahtun@unm.edu; f.r.jensenius@stv.uio.no,,"Htun, Mala/0000-0001-5164-2116",Andrew Carnegie Corporation; Norwegian Research Council [250753],Andrew Carnegie Corporation; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),This research was conducted with support from the Andrew Carnegie Corporation and the Norwegian Research Council (project no. 250753).,,93,13,20,2,12,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0043-8871,1086-3338,,WORLD POLIT,World Polit.,JAN,2022,74,1,,,,,1,36,,10.1017/S0043887121000186,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0043887121000186,,22-Jan,36,International Relations; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),International Relations; Government & Law,YT9RM,,,,,1/2/25,WOS:000740869700001,,1,4

Community-based data are used drawn from women surveyed in two culturally distinct sites of rural India: Uttar Pradesh in the north, in which gender relations are highly stratified, and Tamil Nadu in the south, in which they are more egalitarian. Results suggest that wife-beating is deeply entrenched, that attitudes uniformly justify wife-beating and that few women can escape an abusive marriage. They also suggest that the health consequences of domestic violence-in terms of pregnancy loss and infant mortality-are considerable and that Indian women's experience of infant and fetal mortality is powerfully conditioned by the strength of the patriarchal social system. Results are tentative because of data limitations, but they are consistent and strong enough to warrant concern. They argue for the integration of services to identify, refer, and prevent domestic violence in the primary or reproductive health programs of the country and for the safe motherhood programs to be particularly vigilant, sensitive, and responsive to the conditions of battered women during pregnancy and the postpartum period.","WHO, Special Programme Res Dev & Res Training Human Re, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland",World Health Organization,"Jejeebhoy, SJ (corresponding author), WHO, Special Programme Res Dev & Res Training Human Re, Ave Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,19,162,181,0,10,POPULATION COUNCIL,NEW YORK,"ONE DAG HAMMARSKJOLD PLAZA, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0039-3665,,,STUD FAMILY PLANN,Stud.

Nonetheless, significant and varying gender gaps in this support become evident when we analyze public opinion over time and across generations. I utilize longitudinal survey data from national samples of three generations that came of age in the pre-women's movement era, during the era, and in the postmovement era, respectively. Three main indicators of attitudes about gender equality are employed and two types of gaps are formulated. Contemporaneous gender gaps-the differences between men and women at a given time-tended to increase over time and across succeeding generations. Longitudinal gaps, the differences in support between men and women across generations at different points in time, took the form of women becoming more liberal than men. Signs of growing resentment or ambivalence about gender equality among men appeared in the postmovement generation. A combination of generation and period effects accounts for these dynamics, the key factor being the interaction of gender with generational location and secular tides.","[Jennings, M.

The first part of the study assesses the relative influence of culture in comparison to gender, age, level of education and area of specialization of 533 respondents born in and Currently residing in 7 nations. We found that a significant portion of the variance in the preference for abstract conceptualization was explained by culture, gender, level of education and area of specialization. The variability in preference for active experimentation over reflective observation was accounted for by age and area of specialization. The impact of culture was only marginally significant. In the second part of the study where we examined the influence of individual Culture dimensions in shaping the learning style preferences, we discovered that individuals tend to have a more abstract learning style in countries that are high in in-group collectivism, institutional collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, future orientation and gender egalitarianism. Individuals may have a more reflective learning style in countries that are high in in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and assertiveness. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet as white men have continued to become more Republican in recent years, white women increasingly identify with the Democrats. To the extent that cultural issues are influencing this partisan change, men and women must be responding differently to this cultural agenda. Using a pooled ANES data set from 1988 through 2000, I explore the extent to which cultural values are responsible for this gender realignment. Findings suggest that salient cultural issues influence the partisan choices of both men and women, however in somewhat different ways. For women, the issues themselves reproductive rights, female equality, and legal protection for homosexuals have become increasingly important determinants of party identification. For men, the influence of cultural conflict on partisanship is argued to be equally pervasive, albeit less direct.","Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, 3140 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kkaufmann@gvpt.umd.edu,,,,,,,53,99,128,1,14,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0190-9320,1573-6687,,POLIT BEHAV,Polit.

The authors argue that this approach obscures theoretically important distinctions in attitudes and renders analyses of change over time incomplete. Using latent class analysis, they investigate the multidimensional nature of gender-role attitudes in 17 postindustrial European countries. They identify three distinct varieties of egalitarianism that they designate as liberal egalitarianism, egalitarian familism, and flexible egalitarianism. They show that while traditional gender-role attitudes have precipitously and uniformly declined in accordance with the rising tide narrative toward greater egalitarianism, the relative prevalence of different egalitarianisms varies markedly across countries. Furthermore, they find that European nations are not converging toward one dominant egalitarian model but rather, remain differentiated by varieties of egalitarianism.","[Knight, Carly R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brinton, Mary C.] Harvard Univ, Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Knight, CR (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,NSF [SES1123885],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"For valuable feedback, the authors thank Jason Beckfield, Bart Bonikowski, Xiana Bueno, Carl Gershenson, Ekedi Mpondo-Dika, David Pedulla, Kim Pernell-Gallagher, Sasha Killewald, Nathan Wilmers, and the AJS reviewers.

Viewing such attitudes as reponses to structural changes in women's relation to the labour market, the possible between- and within-country variations in these attitudes are hypothesized. The data are drawn from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and the results from a large cross-national survey are used. It is found that women are more positive than men, and that the younger, the better-educated and the less religious members of society are the most positive to mother's employment in all three countries. As for the between-country variations, it is found that the Swedes are the most positive and the Norwegians the most negative. It is suggested that Great Britain's longer history of industrialization and of urban married women's employment explains why the British people are more positive towards mothers' employment than Norwegians, despite the Norwegian welfare policies with their much stronger emphasis on supporting gender equality and mothers' employment.","Univ Bergen, Ctr Womens & Gender Res, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Stavanger Coll, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen; University of Bergen,"Wærness, K (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Ctr Womens & Gender Res, NO-5007 Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,,34,67,78,3,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"CORT ADELERSGT 17, PO BOX 2562, SOLLI, 0202 OSLO, NORWAY",0001-6993,,,ACTA SOCIOL,Acta Sociol.,MAR,2001,44,1,,,,,67,79,,10.1177/000169930104400106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000169930104400106,,,13,Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology,421GJ,,,,,1/2/25,WOS:000168056400006,,3,1

We investigate hypotheses derived from three models of attitude change: the exposure model, the interest-based model, and the control model. We find support for hypotheses derived from ail three. Consistent with exposure hypotheses, the adoption of fundamentalist beliefs reduces egalitarianism, while spouses' egalitarianism and spouses' education are positively related to individuals' own egalitarianism. As predicted in both exposure and interest hypotheses, women's entry into employment is positively related to women's egalitarianism, while wives' occupational prestige is positively related to men's egalitarianism. Congruent with the interest model, the presence of a young child is positively associated with women's egalitarianism. Consistent with the exposure model, the number of children in the home reduces men's egalitarianism, and a traditional division of housework decreases women's egalitarianism. Finally, consistent with the gender ideology discrepancy hypothesis, derived from the control model, individuals whose background, work, and family life are inconsistent with their gender ideology at wave 1 shift their gender ideology at wave 2 in a direction that is more compatible with their background, work, and family life: egalitarians with traditional life patterns at wave I are more traditional in their gender ideology at wave 2, and traditionals with egalitarian life patterns at wave I are more egalitarian at wave 2. We discuss the implications of these patterns for larger scale change in gender ideology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The cross-national variation of four aspects of sexual well-being (the emotional and physical satisfaction of sexual relationships, satisfaction with sexual health or function, and the importance of sex in one's life) was explored using cluster analysis, and relationships among sexual well-being, general happiness, and various correlates were examined using ordinary least squares regression and ordered logistic regression.

Or is the emerging belief in fake news itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group's panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump's election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump's rhetoric as candidate and as president-hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America's greatness, and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component.","[Lee, Taeku; Hosam, Christian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, 210 Barrows Hall 1950, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Taeku] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, 210 Barrows Hall 1950, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lee, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, 210 Barrows Hall 1950, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lee, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, 210 Barrows Hall 1950, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",taekulee@berkeley.edu; chosam@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,56,24,28,15,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

This study investigated gender differences in multisource ratings of work-life balance, based on self-reports and supervisors' appraisals of 40,921 managers in 36 countries. Based on a combination of theoretical ideas from social role theory (Eagly & Wood, 2012), prior work-life literature, and gender egalitarianism as a cultural dimension related to societal gender roles, the study tested gender egalitarianism as a moderator of cross-national variations in these gender differences. Based on multilevel (HLM) analyses, results showed more cross-national variation by ratee gender in supervisors' appraisals than self-reports, suggesting that supervisors' perceptions reflected greater influence of societal gender stereotypes. Supervisors rated women lower in work-life balance than men in low egalitarian countries, but similar to men in high egalitarian countries, and only appraisals of women varied depending on egalitarian context. Country gender egalitarian values explained the majority of variation in supervisors' appraisals of women's work-life balance, whereas women's self-reported balance was linked to objective gender inequalities. Taken together, the findings show that supervisors' perceptions of employees' work-life balance differed by ratee gender and country context, with important implications for work-life theory and practical implications for global employers.","[Lyness, Karen S.] CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Lyness, Karen S.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Judiesch, Michael K.] Manhattan Coll, Bronx, NY 10471 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Manhattan University,"Lyness, KS (corresponding author), CUNY, Baruch Coll, Dept Psychol, 55 Lexington Ave,Box B 8-215, New York, NY 10010 USA.",Karen.Lyness@baruch.cuny.edu,"Judiesch, Michael/MHQ-3254-2025; Lyness, Karen/U-2267-2019",,,,,,60,108,146,1,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-994X,1464-0597,,APPL PSYCHOL-INT REV,Appl.

It has never been fully replicated and its predictive properties have been challenged. The purpose of this paper is to provide a test of the model's coherence and utility. Design/methodology/approach Analyses of secondary data, including the World Values Survey, and a new survey across 56 countries represented by nearly 53,000 probabilistically selected respondents. Findings Improved operationalizations of individualism-collectivism (IDV-COLL) suggest it is a robust dimension of national culture. A modern IDV-COLL index supersedes Hofstede's 50 year-old original one. Power distance (PD) seems to be a logical facet of IDV-COLL, rather than an independent dimension. Uncertainty avoidance (UA) lacks internal reliability. Approval of restrictive societal rules and laws is a facet of COLL and is not associated with national anxiety or neuroticism. UA is not a predictor of any of its presumed main correlates: importance of job security, preference for a safe job, trust, racism and xenophobia, subjective well-being, innovation, and economic freedom. The dimension of masculinity-femininity (MAS-FEM) lacks coherence. MAS and FEM job goals and broader values are correlated positively, not negatively, and are not related to the MAS-FEM index. MAS-FEM is not a predictor of any of its presumed main correlates: achievement and competition orientation, help and compassion, preference for a workplace with likeable people, work orientation, religiousness, gender egalitarianism, foreign aid. After a radical reconceptualization and a new operationalization, the so-called fifth dimension (CWD or long-term orientation) becomes more coherent and useful. The new version, called flexibility-monumentalism (FLX-MON), explains the cultural differences between East Asian Confucian societies at one extreme and Latin America plus Africa at the other, and is the best predictor of national differences in educational achievement. Research limitations/implications Differences between subsidiaries of a multinational company, such as IBM around 1970, are not necessarily a good source of knowledge about broad cultural differences. A model of national culture must be validated across a large number of countries from all continents and its predictions should withstand various plausible controls. Much of Hofstede's model (UA, MAS-FEM) fails this test while the remaining part (IDV-COLL, PD, LTO) needs a serious revision. Practical implications Consultancies and business schools still teach Hofstede's model uncritically. They need to be aware of its deficiencies. Originality/value As UA and MAS-FEM are apparently misleading artifacts of Hofstede's IBM data set, a thorough revision of Hofstede's model is proposed, reducing it to two dimensions: IDV-COLL and FLX-MON.","[Minkov, Michael] Varna Univ Management, Sofia Local Ctr, Sofia, Bulgaria",Varna University of Management,"Minkov, M (corresponding author), Varna Univ Management, Sofia Local Ctr, Sofia, Bulgaria.",michaelminkov@yahoo.com,,"Sanchez, Carlos Javier/0000-0002-3869-3530",MediaCom,MediaCom,"The collection of primary data for this study was organized by MediaCom Ltd and the Hofstede Center at Itim International, a Dutch-Finnish cross-cultural consultancy.

In contrast to previous studies, we focus on the contextual level and analyse how factors related to political institutions and actors, and economic and social structure shape citizens' support and the gap in support between men and women. We apply multilevel regression analyses of Eurobarometer data for 27 European countries. Levels of support and gender gaps in support for boardroom quotas vary largely between countries. Contextual factors related to existing quota laws, gender equality in social and economic life, and public opinion towards state intervention are important determinants of cross-national variation. Our results point to an ambiguous relationship of support for gender quotas and actual gender equality in a country. Citizens' endorsement of quotas is low in countries with high levels of formal gender equality. Support is higher in countries where interventionist policies are widely accepted. Also, existing quota laws are positively related to citizens' support of boardroom quotas.","[Moehring, Katja] Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Teney, Celine] Univ Gottingen, Inst Sociol, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Mannheim; University of Gottingen,"Möhring, K (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",moehring@uni-mannheim.de; cteney@uni-goettingen.de,,,"University of Bremen within German federal government and federal states; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Collaborative Research Center 'Political Economy of Reforms' [SFB 884]","University of Bremen within German federal government and federal states; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Collaborative Research Center 'Political Economy of Reforms'(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research was partly funded by the institutional strategy of the University of Bremen within the excellence funding of the German federal government and federal states allocated to the second author, and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Collaborative Research Center SFB 884 'Political Economy of Reforms', allocated to the first author.",,51,14,14,2,17,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1472-4790,1740-388X,,COMP EUR POLIT,Comp.

Using hierarchical analysis, we assess the power of these arguments in Latin America, a region that manifests considerable variation on our central explanatory variables and thus offers important theoretical leverage. We find men's gender attitudes to be highly contingent on elite cues and susceptible to backlash effects in response to women's economic advancement. Also, where women lack national representation, distrust of government promotes support for female leadership as an alternative to the discredited ( male) establishment. The analysis supports existing individual-level explanations of gender attitudes and demonstrates a connection between diffuse democratic values and gender egalitarianism. The findings suggest that recent advances for female politicians in Latin America may be susceptible to reversal, and they illuminate strategies for strengthening women's equality in the region.","[Morgan, Jana] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Buice, Melissa] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Mississippi,"Morgan, J (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",Jana.K.Morgan@gmail.com,,,,,,,72,110,123,1,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

While research has studied why this phenomenon is so persistent, few studies have yet been able to assess the effect of gender ideology and socio-economic resources at the same time, usually due to data restrictions. We use data from the pairfam, a new and innovative German panel study, in order to test the effect of absolute and relative resources as well as his and her gender ideology on the division of housework. We employ a life course perspective and analyze trajectories of couples' housework division over time, using multi-level random effects growth curve models. We find that an egalitarian gender ideology of both him and her significantly predicts more egalitarian division-trajectories, while neither absolute nor relative resources appear to have an effect on the division of housework over time. Furthermore, our results expand the literature by investigating how these processes differ among childless couples and couples who experience the first birth. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled.

A growing body of scholarship suggests that persistently gendered workplace norms and policies limit men's and women's ability to create gender egalitarian relationships at home. In this article, we build on and extend prior research by examining the extent to which institutional constraints, including workplace policies, affect young, unmarried men's and women's preferences for their future work-family arrangements. We also examine how these effects vary across education levels. Drawing on original survey-experimental data, we ask respondents how they would like to structure their future relationships while experimentally manipulating the degree of institutional constraint under which they state their preferences. Two clear patterns emerge. First, as constraints are removed and men and women can opt for an egalitarian relationship, the majority choose this option, regardless of gender or education level. Second, women's relationship structure preferences are more responsive than men's to the removal of institutional constraints through supportive work-family policy interventions. These findings shed light on important questions about the role of institutions in shaping work-family preferences, underscoring the notion that seemingly gender-traditional work-family decisions are largely contingent on the constraints of current workplaces.","[Pedulla, David S.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Pedulla, David S.] Univ Texas Austin, Populat Res Ctr, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Thebaud, Sarah] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Pedulla, DS (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Sociol, 305 E 23rd St,A1700, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",dpedulla@utexas.edu; sthebaud@soc.ucsb.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0957900] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD042849] Funding Source: Medline","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))",,,74,301,396,12,249,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

The scholarship also shows that ideology and prejudice towards the targeted group explain the puzzle with respect to racial affirmative action. In this article, we use unique survey questions included in the 2014 round of the AmericasBarometer in Brazil to show that citizens tend to support electoral gender quotas while rejecting gender-based egalitarianism in a reversed version of the principle-policy puzzle. We argue that a different type of gender attitudes, namely benevolent sexism, shapes support for gender quotas as well as for the principle of equality. While benevolent sexists tend to reject gender equality based on views about gender complementarity and stereotypes about women's purity, they also support quotas as policies to foster such values. Our findings suggest that even though the political and scholarly debates can provide sound normative reasons for the adoption of quotas across different contexts, public support for them often relies on paternalistic views and expectations about the role of women in politics.","[Pereira, Frederico Batista] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Porto, Nathalia F.

Emerging evidence shows that women may be more severely affected by this change. The pandemic, however, may have an impact beyond the immediate restructuring of employment and shift gender-role attitudes within households as a result of changes in the division of household labor. We analyze a representative sample of respondents in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore and show that transitions to unemployment, reductions in working hours and transitions to working from home have been more frequent for women than for men - although not to the same extent across the three countries. We also demonstrate that among couples who had been employed at the start of the pandemic, men express more egalitarian gender-role attitudes if they became unemployed but their partners remained employed, while women express more traditional attitudes if they became unemployed and their partners remained employed. These results indicate that gender-role attitudes might adapt to the lived realities.

We analyzed models predicting support for democracy including views toward gender equality in each set of countries. In non-Arab Muslim countries, there were higher levels of support for women's rights, and those who supported gender equality were significantly more likely to support democracy. The reverse was true in the Arab Muslim countries.

But in a democratic polity, we must attend to the political thought not just of politicos and academics, but ordinary citizens as well. In terms of its political significance, What does equality mean requires answering the question: what does equality mean to the mass public? We thus probe the meanings of gender equality in the public mind, using a unique set of questions included in the National Election Studies 1991 Pilot Study, and contextualized within the literatures of feminist and legal theory and political psychology and public opinion. Most importantly, we distinguish among empirical and normative equality and discontent and among the domains of the polity, economy, and family; feature the problem of equality versus sameness; and consider the relationship of these orientations to people's own structural circumstances and their other policy and political attitudes. Among the key findings, empirical and normative equality and discontent are functionally different and grounded differently in people's everyday experiences; they distinguish among different domains of life and, especially, between public and private; and there are generational differences in the relationship of equality to sameness.

Yet, survey research on racial and gender attitudes tends to treat these components as independent. We apply latent class analysis to a set of racial and gender attitude items from the General Social Survey (1977 to 2018) to identify four configurations of individuals' simultaneous views on race and gender. Two of these configurations hold unified progressive or regressive racial and gender attitudes. The other two formations have discordant racial and gender attitudes, where progressive views on one aspect combine with regressive views on the other. In the majority of survey years, the most commonly held configuration endorsed gender equality but espoused new racialist views that attributed racial disparities to cultural deficiencies. This perspective has become increasingly common since 1977 and is most prevalent among White women and White men, likely due to racial-group interest. Black women and Black men, in contrast, are more likely to embrace progressive racial and gender attitudes. We argue that White men's gender egalitarianism may be rooted in self-interest, aimed at acquiring resources through intimate relationships. In contrast, Black men adopt progressive racial and gender attitudes to form a necessary coalition with Black women to challenge racism.","[Scarborough, William J.; Kwon, Ronald] Univ North Texas, Dept Sociol, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Monasterio, Ronaldo] Univ North Texas, Sociol, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Pepin, Joanna R.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, Buffalo, NY USA; [Lambouths, Danny L., III] Univ Illinois, Sociol, Chicago, IL USA","University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; State University of New York (SUNY) System; University at Buffalo, SUNY; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital","Scarborough, WJ (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Sociol, Sociol, 1155 Union Circle 311157, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",William.Scarborough@unt.edu,,"Lambouths III, Danny/0000-0002-8701-7571; Pepin, Joanna/0000-0002-3134-2121",,,,,100,21,26,5,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Evidence also suggests that women's advancements have been more dramatic in the public sphere of work and politics than in the private sphere of family life. We argue that this lopsided gender progress may be traced to uneven changes in gender attitudes. Using data from more than 27,000 respondents who participated in the General Social Survey from 1977 through 2016, we show that gender attitudes have more than one underlying dimension and that these dimensions have changed at different rates over time. Using latent class analysis, we find that the distribution of respondents' attitudes toward gender equality has changed over the past 40 years. There has been an increase in the number of egalitarians who support equality in public and private spheres, while the traditionals who historically opposed equality in both domains have been replaced by ambivalents who feel differently about gender equality in the public and private spheres. Meanwhile, successive birth cohorts are becoming more egalitarian, with Generation-Xers and Millennials being the most likely to hold strong egalitarian views. The feminist revolution has succeeded in promoting egalitarian views and decreasing the influence of gender traditionalism, but has yet to convince a substantial minority that gender equality should extend to both public and private spheres of social life","[Scarborough, William J.] Univ Illinois, Sociol, Chicago, IL USA; [Sin, Ray] Morningstar Inc, Chicago, IL USA; [Risman, Barbara] Univ Illinois, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Sociol, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Scarborough, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",wscarb2@uic.edu,,"Scarborough, William/0000-0002-1566-4921; Sin, Ray/0000-0002-9128-0874",,,,,49,205,229,13,140,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2432,1552-3977,,GENDER SOC,Gend.

We focus on both partners' earnings and gender role attitudes as explanatory factors. Previous research explored the importance of women's relative income and both partners' gender role attitudes for the extent to which the division of labour becomes more traditional among new parents. We extend this literature by including women's absolute earnings, which may be crucial given the very high costs of formal childcare in Britain. The statistical analysis of 310 couples is based on 16 waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1992-2007) and applies OLS models with Heckman selection correction. The findings suggest that higher absolute wages and more egalitarian attitudes of women before motherhood reduce the shift towards a more traditional division of labour after couples have their first child. In the British context, higher relative wages of women compared to their partners are not significant.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England",University of Cambridge,"Schober, PS (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England.",pss36@cam.ac.uk,,"Schober, Pia/0000-0003-1953-1197",ESRC [ES/G020779/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,119,126,1,80,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,,EUR SOCIOL REV,Eur.

Structural equation Modeling identified a latent trait of 'liberal social attitudes' underlying attitude factors that are antiracist, socially liberal, and in support of gender equality. Another attitude factor-'political trust'-was relatively independent from the latent attitude trait and has somewhat different pathways in relation to the other variables included in the analysis. There was a direct association between higher g at age 11 and more liberal social attitudes and political trust at age 33. For both men and women the association between g and liberal social attitudes was partly mediated via educational qualifications, and to a much lesser extent via adult occupational attainment. For women the association between g and political trust was partly mediated through both educational qualification and occupational attainment, and for men it was mediated mainly via occupational attainment. Men and women who had higher educational qualifications and higher occupational status tend to be more socially liberal and more trusting of the democratic political system. In terms of socio-economic background, people from less privileged families showed less political trust, but did not differ much in liberal social attitudes from those born into relatively more privileged circumstances. This study shows that social background, cognitive ability, education, and own social status influence perceptions of society. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The best-fitting model both fuses those 2 elements into a single construct (Black individualism) and includes them separately. The effects of Black individualism on racial policy preferences are mostly mediated by symbolic racism.

A current debate within this literature deals with the impact of daughters on fathers' political attitudes. In this article, we address this debate in relation to a specific set of policy preferences and ask: Does the experience of fathering daughters affect men's opinions toward gender-equality policies? In addressing this question, this study examines three theoretically motivated propositions: first, that having a daughter leads men to see the benefits of and support public policies that aim to reduce gender inequality; second, that fathers with a larger proportion of daughters express stronger support for these policies; and finally, that having a daughter as a man's first child is a critical event in the political socialization of men, such that this experience of first-daughterhood will lead to higher levels of support for gender-equality policies. We use original representative survey data from a module on the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to test these three hypotheses. The results of our analyses suggest that the experience of having a daughter as a first child-but not the effect of having a daughter in general nor the experience of fathering a higher proportion of daughters-significantly increases fathers' support for policies designed to increase gender equality.","[Sharrow, Elizabeth A.; Rhodes, Jesse H.; Nteta, Tatishe M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, 200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Sharrow, Elizabeth A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Hist, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Greenlee, Jill S.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Polit, Waltham, MA USA; [Greenlee, Jill S.] Brandeis Univ, Womens Gender & Sexual Studies Program, Waltham, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Brandeis University; Brandeis University,"Sharrow, EA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, 200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",sharrow@polsci.umass.edu,,"Sharrow, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5880-7905; Greenlee, Jill/0000-0002-5185-7931","University of Massachusetts-Amherst; National Science Foundation [1559125]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1559125] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","University of Massachusetts-Amherst; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was supported by a Faculty Research Grant from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst [to T.N.].

Education influences gender attitudes in multiple ways at both the micro- and macrolevels. Better-educated individuals hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, and this positive effect of individual education is larger for women than for men, indicating a strong empowerment effect for women. Egalitarian gender attitudes trickle down through education, as individuals in communities with high education are socialized toward more egalitarian attitudes. Community education has a larger effect toward the egalitarian direction on the attitude toward the importance of having sons than on the attitude toward women's marriage rights, indicating that change in the latter attitude occurred earlier and has now spread via education.

This holds even after we attempt to account for social desirability bias. Second, there are significant individual- and country-level determinants of stereotyping. In countries with higher women's representation and labor force participation but without gender quotas, citizens are more likely to choose pro-female and neutral responses over pro-male stereotypes. At the individual level, those rejecting stereotypes are less authoritarian, more supportive of labor market equality, and more leftist than those reporting pro-female stereotypes. Third, the consequences for representation vary by partisanship and country context. Pro-female leadership stereotypes boost support for women presidential candidates and for legislative gender quotas, but they matter less among copartisans of women candidates, and they matter more when women candidates are viable but gendered outsiders. Those rejecting leadership stereotypes altogether are less supportive of quotas.","[Smith, Amy Erica; Warming, Katherine] Iowa State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hennings, Valerie M.] Morningside Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Sioux City, IA USA",Iowa State University,"Smith, AE (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",aesmith2@iastate.edu,"Smith, Amy/AEP-5625-2022",,,,,,90,13,13,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2156-5503,2156-5511,,POLIT GROUPS IDENTIT,Polit.

And do more men than women still vote for the PRR? Can attitudes regarding gender and gender equality explain these differences (if they exist)? These are the questions that Spierings and Zaslove explore in this article. They begin with an analysis of men's and women's voting patterns for PRR parties in seven countries, comparing these results with voting for mainstream (left-wing and right-wing) parties. They then examine the relationship between attitudes and votes for the populist radical right, focusing on economic redistribution, immigration, trust in the European Union, law and order, environmental protection, personal freedom and development, support for gender equality, and homosexuality. They conclude that more men than women do indeed support PRR parties, as many studies have previously demonstrated. However, the difference is often overemphasized in the literature, in part since it is examined in isolation and not compared with voting for (centre-right) mainstream parties. Moreover, the most important reasons that voters support PRR parties seem to be the same for men and for women; both vote for the populist radical right because of their opposition to immigration. In general, there are no consistent cross-country patterns regarding gender attitudes explaining differences between men and women. There are some recurring country-specific findings though. Most notably: first, among women, economic positions seem to matter less; and economically more left-wing (and those with anti-immigrant attitudes) women also vote for the PRR in Belgium, France, Norway and Switzerland; and, second, those who hold authoritarian or nativist views in combination with a strong belief that gays and lesbians should be able to 'live their lives as they choose' are disproportionately much more likely to vote for PRR parties in Sweden and Norway. Despite these findings, Spierings and Zaslove argue that the so-called 'gender gap' is often overemphasized. In other words, it appears that populist radical-right parties, with respect to sex and gender, are in many ways simply a more radical version of centre-right parties.","[Spierings, Niels] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Sociol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Spierings, Niels] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Zaslove, Andrej] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Polit Sci, Comparat Polit, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Spierings, N (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.spierings@maw.ru.nl; a.zaslove@fm.ru.nl,"Spierings, Niels/H-9812-2016",,,,,,37,92,98,11,106,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0031-322X,1461-7331,,PATTERNS PREJUDICE,Patterns Prejudice,MAR 15,2015,49,1-2,,,SI,,135,162,,10.1080/0031322X.2015.1024404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0031322X.2015.1024404,,,28,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Ethnic Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Ethnic Studies,CG7FY,,Green Published,,,2025-03-05,WOS:000353469300007,View Full Record in Web of Science,7,1

After describing the frames we discuss an experimental test of four of the media packages on voters' political attitudes using a non-random sample of adults. Experimental results indicate that the economic rights and anti-feminism frames had a strong, negative impact on subject attitudes toward gender equality, support for women's rights, support for non-traditional gender roles and the frequency with which subjects mentioned women's issues as among the most important issues facing the U.S. In addition, the feminism frame also exerted negative effects; while, conversely, the political rights frame had a positive influence on similar gender attitudes.

The picture emerging from this analysis is complex, eluding the simple dichotomy between prima facie support and second order incongruence with democracy, which characterises current debates. Respondents have a more holistic understanding of democracy than is found in current scholarship or indeed pursued by Western or regional policymakers, valuing civil-political rights but prioritizing socio-economic rights. There is broad consensus behind principles of gender equality, but indirect questions reveal the continuing influence of conservative and patriarchal attitudes. Respondents value religion, but do not trust religious leaders or want them to meddle in elections or government. Moreover, while there is broad support for conventionally-understood pillars of liberal democracy (free elections, a parliamentary system), there is also a significant gap between those who support democracy as the best political system in principle and those who also believe it is actually suitable for their country.","[Teti, Andrea] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Abbott, Pamela] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Educ, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Cavatorta, Francesco] Univ Laval, Dept Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; Laval University,"Abbott, P (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Educ, Aberdeen, Scotland.",p.abbott@abdn.ac.uk,"; Teti, Giuseppe Andrea/G-9074-2018; Abbott, Pamela/AAD-1501-2019","Cavatorta, Francesco/0000-0003-2249-1392; Teti, Giuseppe Andrea/0000-0003-0751-4445; Abbott, Pamela/0000-0002-5013-343X",European Commission [320214],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The Arab Transformations Project, Political and Social Transformations in the Arab World, was funded under the European Commission's FP7 Framework [grant agreement number 320214].",,62,42,44,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1351-0347,1743-890X,,DEMOCRATIZATION,Democratization,19-May,2019,26,4,,,,,645,665,,10.1080/13510347.2019.1566903,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2019.1566903,,,21,Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,IK4LR,,Green Submitted,,,1/2/25,WOS:000476558900005,,4,1

The article focuses on attitudes toward a wide range of family issues, including the roles of men and women, marriage, divorce, childlessness, premarital sex, extramarital sex, unmarried cohabitation, and unmarried childbearing. More generally, the article considers trends in 3 broad contemporary values: freedom; equality; and commitment to family, marriage, and children. Five data sets are used for the article: Monitoring the Future, General Social Survey, International Social Science Project, Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children, and the National Survey, of Families and Households. These 5 data sets reveal substantial and persistent long-term trends toward the endorsement of gender equality in families, which may have plateaued at very high levels in recent years. There have also been important and continuing long-term trends toward individual autonomy and tolerance toward a diversity of personal and family behaviors as reflected in increased acceptance of divorce, premarital sex, unmarried cohabitation, remaining single, and choosing to be childless. At the same time, marriage and family life remain important in the cultural ethos, with large and relatively stable fractions of young people believing that marriage and family life are important and planning marriage and the bearing and rearing of children.","Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Res Ctr, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA.",arlandt@umich.edu,,,,,,,31,641,864,3,162,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2445,1741-3737,,J MARRIAGE FAM,J.

Consistent with pioneering feminist theories of gender stratification, this cross-national study demonstrates this approach with multi-level models that consider individual as well as cultural and structural variables that are associated with the absolute time men and women spend doing housework. Building on research relating national gender ideology to the husband-wife shares of housework, this paper asks how gender ideology relates to the absolute amount of time that men and women spend doing housework. Complementing this cultural indicator, the paper introduces a previously neglected constraint on domestic practices, asking whether the quality of a country's housing stock predicts weekly hours in housework. Drawing on 2012 International Social Survey Program data for 20 European countries, we study nationally representative samples totaling 7733 respondents who were ages 18-65 and legally married, cohabiting, or in civil partnerships. Even controlling for individual-level covariates, results confirm that men and women perform less housework in countries where public opinion supports gender equality. In countries with more substandard housing, however, women, but not men, spend more time in housework than they do elsewhere.","[Treas, Judith] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Sociol, Social Sci Bldg 3151A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Tai, Tsuio] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Sociol, Social Sci Bldg,151 Univ Rd, Taipei 237, Taiwan",University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Taipei University,"Treas, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Sociol, Social Sci Bldg 3151A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jktreas@uci.edu; tsuiot@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,82,88,2,86,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0360-0025,1573-2762,,SEX ROLES,Sex Roles,MAY,2016,74,12-Nov,,,SI,,495,511,,10.1007/s11199-015-0575-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-015-0575-9,,,17,"Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Social; Women's Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Women's Studies,DM1NG,,,,,1/2/25,WOS:000376111700003,,19,1

Using longitudinal survey data and fixed effects, findings suggest that exposure to these experiences influences gender ideology, though with greater variation than previous work has detected. Marriage exerts an egalitarian influence on Blacks but a less egalitarian one on whites. Parenthood has a less egalitarian effect for all married parents but an egalitarian one for most unmarried parents. These findings suggest that gender ideology is dynamic and life experiences are important sources of change. Furthermore, this change depends on individuals' race-gender categories and the configuration of life events to which they are exposed. These nuanced findings amend past work by better identifying for whom and under which conditions life experiences shape gender ideology. In doing so, this study illustrates how the conceptual and methodological approaches help us understand gender ideology construction by revealing substantial variation that went undetected in past work.","Ohio State Univ, Ctr Human Resource Res, Columbus, OH 43221 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Vespa, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Ctr Human Resource Res, 921 Chatham Lane,Suite 100, Columbus, OH 43221 USA.",jvespa@chrr.osu.edu,,,,,,,63,99,147,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2432,,,GENDER SOC,Gend.

Rather, in examining women's marital quality and men's emotional investments in marriage, we find that dyadic commitment to institutional ideals about marriage and women's contentment with the division of household tasks are more critical. We also show that men's marital emotion work is a very important determinant of women's marital quality. We conclude by noting that her marriage is happiest when it combines elements of the new and old: that is, gender equity and normative commitment to the institution of marriage.","Univ Virginia, Dept Sociol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Univ Virginia, Dept Sociol, POB 400766, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",wbwilcox@virginia.edu,,,,,,,56,178,253,4,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Men's attitudes have become more egalitarian over this period, however, men approve more of sharing provider-role enactment than of sharing provider-role responsibility. Cohort succession was a more important source of change than change within cohorts. Differences among men in attitudes toward the provider role were associated with differences in men's provider-role experiences, although there was a time lag between change in actual experience and change in attitudes. The findings suggest that structural change in the economy of the family that has changed men's experience as breadwinners is the major force altering gender expectations about family roles.

While examining macrolevel predictors and outcomes, the arguments put forth in these studies rely heavily on theories linking individuals' attitudes toward gender equality to individuals' beliefs in the appropriateness of violence as a. means of attaining political or social objectives. In this research, we explore the inicrofoundations of the gender equality peace thesis by examining the conditional impact of beliefs about gender egalitarianism on support for the use of force to achieve foreign policy objectives. Using data from a nationally representative survey of US citizens, we find that as the strength of gender egalitarian attitudes increases, respondents' support for the use of force to achieve traditional security objectives declines. Importantly, however, our results suggest that gender egalitarian attitudes exert the strongest suppressive effect on support for the use force among male respondents: rising gender egalitarianism among men effectively closes the gender gap in support for the use of force. Consequently, these results provide microlevel support for the relationship between gender equality and peace found in macrolevel observational analyses.","[Wood, Reed; Ramirez, Mark D.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Wood, R (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,"Wood, Reed/AAB-8402-2019; Ramirez, Mark/I-8444-2014","Ramirez, Mark/0000-0002-0988-2746",School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University,School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University,"We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and editors at International Studies Review for many helpful comments and suggestions.

Self-labeling was most clearly defined as a binary declaration of being a feminist or not, which alone was related to increased feminist activism above and beyond the impact of feminist beliefs. Furthermore, self-labeling, unlike feminist beliefs, was not related to personal well-being or interpersonal egalitarianism. Our findings confirm the exclusive and singular importance of self-labeling for enhanced feminist action.","[Yoder, Janice D.; Tobias, Ann; Snell, Andrea F.] Univ Akron, Dept Psychol, Akron, OH 44235 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Yoder, JD (corresponding author), Univ Akron, Dept Psychol, Akron, OH 44235 USA.",jyoder@uakron.edu,,,,,,,43,99,127,1,38,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0360-0025,1573-2762,,SEX ROLES,Sex Roles,JAN,2011,64,1-2,,,,,9,18,,10.1007/s11199-010-9890-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-010-9890-3,,,10,"Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Social; Women's Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Women's Studies,702EB,,,,,2025-03-05,WOS:000285876300002,View Full Record in Web of Science,1,1
