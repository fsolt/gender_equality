	abstract = {This paper uses data from the World Value Surveys (1990, 1995,1999) to
   investigate the impact of gender role attitudes and work values on
   women's labour-market outcomes across 25 OECD countries.
   Anti-egalitarian views are found to display the strongest negative
   association with female employment rates and the gender pay gap. These
   views are, however, softening among recent cohorts. On the other hand,
   perceptions of women's role as homemakers, which are likely formed in
   youth and linked to religious ideology, are more persistent over time.
   They could be implicated in the recent slowdown of the gender
   convergence in pay. Finally, the unavoidable clash between family values
   and egalitarian views, that takes the form of an inner conflict for many
   women-the so-called `mother's guilt'-is another obstacle in the path
   towards greater gender equality in the labour market.},

@article{Bettinsoli2020,
	abstract = {Dominant accounts of sexual prejudice posit that negative attitudes
   toward nonheterosexual individuals are stronger for male (vs. female)
   targets, higher among men (vs. women), and driven, in part, by the
   perception that gay men and lesbian women violate traditional gender
   norms. We test these predictions in 23 countries, representing both
   Western and non-Western societies. Results show that (1) gay men are
   disliked more than lesbian women across all countries; (2) after
   adjusting for endorsement of traditional gender norms, the relationship
   between participant gender and sexual prejudice is inconsistent across
   Western countries, but men (vs. women) in non-Western countries
   consistently report more negative attitudes toward gay men; and (3) a
   significant association between gender norm endorsement and sexual
   prejudice across countries, but it was absent or reversed in China,
   India, and South Korea. Taken together, this work suggests that gender
   and sexuality may be more loosely associated in some non-Western
   contexts.},

@article{Kroska2009,
	abstract = {Using a sample of continuously-married individuals (793 women and 847
   men) and their spouses drawn from the first two waves of the NSFH, we
   examine change in individuals' attitudes about mothers' employment. We
   investigate hypotheses derived from three models of attitude change: the
   exposure model, the interest-based model, and the control model. We find
   support for hypotheses derived from ail three. Consistent with exposure
   hypotheses, the adoption of fundamentalist beliefs reduces
   egalitarianism, while spouses' egalitarianism and spouses' education are
   positively related to individuals' own egalitarianism. As predicted in
   both exposure and interest hypotheses, women's entry into employment is
   positively related to women's egalitarianism, while wives' occupational
   prestige is positively related to men's egalitarianism. Congruent with
   the interest model, the presence of a young child is positively
   associated with women's egalitarianism. Consistent with the exposure
   model, the number of children in the home reduces men's egalitarianism,
   and a traditional division of housework decreases women's
   egalitarianism. Finally, consistent with the gender ideology discrepancy
   hypothesis, derived from the control model, individuals whose
   background, work, and family life are inconsistent with their gender
   ideology at wave 1 shift their gender ideology at wave 2 in a direction
   that is more compatible with their background, work, and family life:
   egalitarians with traditional life patterns at wave I are more
   traditional in their gender ideology at wave 2, and traditionals with
   egalitarian life patterns at wave I are more egalitarian at wave 2. We
   discuss the implications of these patterns for larger scale change in
   gender ideology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Nitsche2016,
	abstract = {In the 21st century, the division of housework remains gendered, with
   women on average still spending more time doing chores than their male
   partners. While research has studied why this phenomenon is so
   persistent, few studies have yet been able to assess the effect of
   gender ideology and socio-economic resources at the same time, usually
   due to data restrictions. We use data from the pairfam, a new and
   innovative German panel study, in order to test the effect of absolute
   and relative resources as well as his and her gender ideology on the
   division of housework. We employ a life course perspective and analyze
   trajectories of couples' housework division over time, using multi-level
   random effects growth curve models. We find that an egalitarian gender
   ideology of both him and her significantly predicts more egalitarian
   division-trajectories, while neither absolute nor relative resources
   appear to have an effect on the division of housework over time.
   Furthermore, our results expand the literature by investigating how
   these processes differ among childless couples and couples who
   experience the first birth. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

@article{Spierings2015,
	abstract = {Why do more men than women vote for populist radical-right (PRR)
   parties? And do more men than women still vote for the PRR? Can
   attitudes regarding gender and gender equality explain these differences
   (if they exist)? These are the questions that Spierings and Zaslove
   explore in this article. They begin with an analysis of men's and
   women's voting patterns for PRR parties in seven countries, comparing
   these results with voting for mainstream (left-wing and right-wing)
   parties. They then examine the relationship between attitudes and votes
   for the populist radical right, focusing on economic redistribution,
   immigration, trust in the European Union, law and order, environmental
   protection, personal freedom and development, support for gender
   equality, and homosexuality. They conclude that more men than women do
   indeed support PRR parties, as many studies have previously
   demonstrated. However, the difference is often overemphasized in the
   literature, in part since it is examined in isolation and not compared
   with voting for (centre-right) mainstream parties. Moreover, the most
   important reasons that voters support PRR parties seem to be the same
   for men and for women; both vote for the populist radical right because
   of their opposition to immigration. In general, there are no consistent
   cross-country patterns regarding gender attitudes explaining differences
   between men and women. There are some recurring country-specific
   findings though. Most notably: first, among women, economic positions
   seem to matter less; and economically more left-wing (and those with
   anti-immigrant attitudes) women also vote for the PRR in Belgium,
   France, Norway and Switzerland; and, second, those who hold
   authoritarian or nativist views in combination with a strong belief that
   gays and lesbians should be able to `live their lives as they choose'
   are disproportionately much more likely to vote for PRR parties in
   Sweden and Norway. Despite these findings, Spierings and Zaslove argue
   that the so-called `gender gap' is often overemphasized. In other words,
   it appears that populist radical-right parties, with respect to sex and
   gender, are in many ways simply a more radical version of centre-right
   parties.},

	abstract = {It has been argued that gender essentialism impedes progress towards
   greater gender equality. Here we present a new gender essentialism scale
   (GES), and validate it in two large nationally representative samples
   from Denmark and Australia. In both samples the GES was highly reliable
   and predicted lack of support for sex-role egalitarianism and support
   for gender discrimination, as well as perceived fairness of gender-based
   treatment in the Australian sample, independently of two established
   predictors (i.e., social dominance orientation and conservative
   political orientation). In addition, gender essentialism assessed by the
   GES moderated some manifestations of the backlash effect: high
   essentialists were more likely to respond negatively towards a
   power-seeking female political candidate relative to a male candidate.
   Given the implications for possible workplace interventions, further
   work could usefully explore whether gender essentialism moderates other
   well-established forms of gender bias.},

	abstract = {This study explores whether the diffusion of gender-equitable attitudes
   towards female employment is associated with fertility. We argue that
   any positive effect on fertility requires not only high levels of
   gender-equitable attitudes overall, but also attitude convergence
   between men and women. We analyse 27 countries using data from the World
   Values Surveys and European Values Studies. We find support for a
   U-shaped relationship between changes in gender role attitudes and
   fertility: an initial drop in fertility is observed as countries move
   from a traditional to a more gender-symmetric model. Beyond a certain
   threshold, additional increases in gender egalitarianism become
   positively associated with fertility. This curvi-linear relationship is
   moderated by the difference in attitudes between men and women: when
   there is more agreement, changes are more rapid and the effect of gender
   egalitarian attitudes on fertility strengthens.},

   muting challenges to gender inequality, and they explore that argument

   Women's dependence at both the societal and the individual levels is
   associated with less egalitarian gender altitudes; such dependence
   especially affects women's attitudes drawing them toward men's less
   egalitarian views. Societal-level dependence also strengthens the impact

   women. Looking forward, if women do become well represented in a
   profession, does this mean equality has been achieved? Are issues of
   bias resolved? Two studies including a randomized double-blind
   experiment demonstrate that biases persist even when women become well
   represented (evinced in veterinary medicine). Evidence included managers
   evaluating an employee randomly assigned a male (versus female) name as
   more competent and advising a \$3475.00 higher salary, equating to an
   8\% pay gap. Importantly, those who thought bias was not happening in
   their field were the key drivers of it-a ``high risk{''} group
   (including men and women) that, as shown, can be readily
   identified/assessed. Thus, as other professions make gains in women's
   representation, it is vital to recognize that discrimination can
   persist-perpetuated by those who think it is not happening.},

   change similarly on this dimension, women held more egalitarian views

@article{Cunningham2005,
	abstract = {Using data from a 31-year panel study, we investigate reciprocal
   relationships between individuals' attitudes about gender and their
   experience with a range of social settings commonly associated with the
   transition to adulthood. These settings include school, the labor
   market, independent living arrangements, cohabitation, marriage, and
   parenthood. We consider the extent to which gender and age moderate the
   relationships between attitudes about gender and exposure to these
   social contexts. Ordinary least squares regression and hazard models
   demonstrate that support for egalitarian roles for women and men in
   families is positively linked to subsequent school enrollment, women's
   full-time employment, and independent living, but negatively associated
   with the subsequent timing of entry into marriage and marital
   parenthood. Accumulated schooling, independent living, and full-time
   employment are associated with changes in individuals' attitudes about
   gender. Despite careful attention to gender differences, we find
   surprisingly little evidence that the causes and consequences of
   attitudes about gender differ for women and men, with the primary
   exception being the positive association of employment and egalitarian
   gender attitudes for women but not for men. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

@article{Donnelly2016,
	abstract = {We examine time period and generational differences in attitudes toward
   women's work and family roles in two large, nationally representative
   U.S. samples, the Monitoring the Future survey of 12th graders
   (1976-2013) and the General Social Survey of adults (1977-2012). Twelfth
   graders became more accepting of working mothers and equal roles for
   women in the workplace between the 1970s and the 2010s, with most change
   occurring between the 1970s and the late 1990s. Acceptance of
   dual-income families and fathers working half-time or not at all
   (stay-at-home dads) also increased. Thus, for the most part, Millennials
   (born 1980s-1990s) have continued trends toward more egalitarian gender
   roles. However, slightly more 12th graders in the 2010s (vs. the late
   1990s) favored the husband as the achiever and decision maker in the
   family. Adults' attitudes toward working mothers became more egalitarian
   between the 1970s and the early 1990s, showed a small backlash in the
   late 1990s, and then continued the trend toward increased egalitarianism
   in the 2000s and 2010s. In hierarchical linear modeling analyses
   separating the effects of time period, generation/cohort, and age,
   trends were primarily due to time period with a generational peak in
   egalitarianism among White women Boomers (born 1946-1964). Policy makers
   should recognize that support for working mothers is now a solid
   majority position in the United States and design programs for working
   families accordingly.},

   increasing labor force participation among various groups of women such
   as chose with preschool children and those of Hispanic origin, and the
   purported egalitarian impact of labor force participation on gender role
   attitudes. The General Social Surveys include 9833 women who responded
   to the gender role questions with 1132 black (11.5\%) and 351 Hispanic
   (3.6\%) women. Our results refine earlier bivariate findings about the
   impact of specific types of life experiences and family power dynamics
   on women's views about appropriate roles for men and women. Most
   importantly, we find that there may be an ubiquitous shift toward more
   egalitarian gender role attitudes among women in the U.S. regardless of

@article{Kaufmann2002,
	abstract = {Changes in the U.S. partisan balance over the past decade are often
   attributed to the enhanced political salience of cultural issues. Yet as
   white men have continued to become more Republican in recent years,
   white women increasingly identify with the Democrats. To the extent that
   cultural issues are influencing this partisan change, men and women must
   be responding differently to this cultural agenda. Using a pooled ANES
   data set from 1988 through 2000, I explore the extent to which cultural
   values are responsible for this gender realignment. Findings suggest
   that salient cultural issues influence the partisan choices of both men
   and women, however in somewhat different ways. For women, the issues
   themselves reproductive rights, female equality, and legal protection
   for homosexuals have become increasingly important determinants of party
   identification. For men, the influence of cultural conflict on
   partisanship is argued to be equally pervasive, albeit less direct.},

@article{Lyness2014,
	abstract = {Work-life balance has important implications for both personal
   well-being and work-related outcomes. This study investigated gender
   differences in multisource ratings of work-life balance, based on
   self-reports and supervisors' appraisals of 40,921 managers in 36
   countries. Based on a combination of theoretical ideas from social role
   theory (Eagly \& Wood, 2012), prior work-life literature, and gender
   egalitarianism as a cultural dimension related to societal gender roles,
   the study tested gender egalitarianism as a moderator of cross-national
   variations in these gender differences. Based on multilevel (HLM)
   analyses, results showed more cross-national variation by ratee gender
   in supervisors' appraisals than self-reports, suggesting that
   supervisors' perceptions reflected greater influence of societal gender
   stereotypes. Supervisors rated women lower in work-life balance than men
   in low egalitarian countries, but similar to men in high egalitarian
   countries, and only appraisals of women varied depending on egalitarian
   context. Country gender egalitarian values explained the majority of
   variation in supervisors' appraisals of women's work-life balance,
   whereas women's self-reported balance was linked to objective gender
   inequalities. Taken together, the findings show that supervisors'
   perceptions of employees' work-life balance differed by ratee gender and
   country context, with important implications for work-life theory and
   practical implications for global employers.},

   nations from each society and found significant differences in attitudes
   toward gender equality, democratic governance and religious identities.
   We analyzed models predicting support for democracy including views
   toward gender equality in each set of countries. In non-Arab Muslim
   countries, there were higher levels of support for women's rights, and
   those who supported gender equality were significantly more likely to
   support democracy. The reverse was true in the Arab Muslim countries. We
   argue that for a complete and unbiased form of democracy to emerge in
   the Arab Middle East, a rule of law that would protect gender equality,
   minority rights and citizen inclusion would need to be instituted.},

   and women in couples for how they change their time spent on housework
   and paid work after the transition to parenthood. We focus on both
   partners' earnings and gender role attitudes as explanatory factors.
   Previous research explored the importance of women's relative income and
   both partners' gender role attitudes for the extent to which the
   division of labour becomes more traditional among new parents. We extend
   this literature by including women's absolute earnings, which may be
   crucial given the very high costs of formal childcare in Britain. The
   statistical analysis of 310 couples is based on 16 waves of the British
   Household Panel Survey (1992-2007) and applies OLS models with Heckman
   selection correction. The findings suggest that higher absolute wages
   and more egalitarian attitudes of women before motherhood reduce the
   shift towards a more traditional division of labour after couples have
   their first child. In the British context, higher relative wages of
   women compared to their partners are not significant.},

@article{Schoon2010,
	abstract = {We examined the prospective associations between family socio-economic
   background, childhood intelligence (g) at age 11, educational and
   occupational attainment, and social attitudes at age 33 in a large (N =
   8804), representative sample of the British population born in 1958.
   Structural equation Modeling identified a latent trait of `liberal
   social attitudes' underlying attitude factors that are antiracist,
   socially liberal, and in support of gender equality. Another attitude
   factor-'political trust'-was relatively independent from the latent
   attitude trait and has somewhat different pathways in relation to the
   other variables included in the analysis. There was a direct association
   between higher g at age 11 and more liberal social attitudes and
   political trust at age 33. For both men and women the association
   between g and liberal social attitudes was partly mediated via
   educational qualifications, and to a much lesser extent via adult
   occupational attainment. For women the association between g and
   political trust was partly mediated through both educational
   qualification and occupational attainment, and for men it was mediated
   mainly via occupational attainment. Men and women who had higher
   educational qualifications and higher occupational status tend to be
   more socially liberal and more trusting of the democratic political
   system. In terms of socio-economic background, people from less
   privileged families showed less political trust, but did not differ much
   in liberal social attitudes from those born into relatively more
   privileged circumstances. This study shows that social background,
   cognitive ability, education, and own social status influence
   perceptions of society. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier

@article{Shu2004,
	abstract = {This study examined Chinese attitudes toward women's careers, marriage
   rights, sexual freedom, and the importance of having sons using a 1991
   national sample of individuals and community-level data and through a
   series of nested multilevel models. Education influences gender
   attitudes in multiple ways at both the micro- and macrolevels.
   Better-educated individuals hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, and
   this positive effect of individual education is larger for women than
   for men, indicating a strong empowerment effect for women. Egalitarian
   gender attitudes trickle down through education, as individuals in
   communities with high education are socialized toward more egalitarian
   attitudes. Community education has a larger effect toward the
   egalitarian direction on the attitude toward the importance of having
   sons than on the attitude toward women's marriage rights, indicating
   that change in the latter attitude occurred earlier and has now spread
   via education. These findings show that education is a vehicle of
   socialization that is used by both the domestic power elite (the
   Communist Party) and the Western culture.},

@article{Vespa2009,
	abstract = {Using life course and intersectional perspectives, this study examines
   how changes in life experiences such as marriage, parenthood, and work
   are associated with changes in individuals' gender ideology. Using
   longitudinal survey data and fixed effects, findings suggest that
   exposure to these experiences influences gender ideology, though with
   greater variation than previous work has detected. Marriage exerts an
   egalitarian influence on Blacks but a less egalitarian one on whites.
   Parenthood has a less egalitarian effect for all married parents but an
   egalitarian one for most unmarried parents. These findings suggest that
   gender ideology is dynamic and life experiences are important sources of
   change. Furthermore, this change depends on individuals' race-gender
   categories and the configuration of life events to which they are
   exposed. These nuanced findings amend past work by better identifying
   for whom and under which conditions life experiences shape gender
   ideology. In doing so, this study illustrates how the conceptual and
   methodological approaches help us understand gender ideology
   construction by revealing substantial variation that went undetected in
   past work.},

   provider role using data from the National Opinion Research Center
   General Social Surveys for 1972 through 1989. Men's attitudes have
   become more egalitarian over this period, however, men approve more of
   sharing provider-role enactment than of sharing provider-role
   responsibility. Cohort succession was a more important source of change
   than change within cohorts. Differences among men in attitudes toward
   the provider role were associated with differences in men's
   provider-role experiences, although there was a time lag between change
   in actual experience and change in attitudes. The findings suggest that
   structural change in the economy of the family that has changed men's
   experience as breadwinners is the major force altering gender
   expectations about family roles. Attitudes among some groups of men,
   those not directly affected by these changes and married men who gain

Previous cross-national research on women in national legislatures has stressed three explanations for differences in women's political representation: social structure, politics, and ideology. Despite strong theory suggesting the importance of ideology, it has not found support in previous cross-national statistical studies. But ideology has not been as well measured as structural and political factors. In this article, we demonstrate that gender ideology strongly affects the number of women in national legislatures. We do so by introducing a newly available measure of national gender ideology into a cross-national model of women in legislatures. We demonstrate that ideology, when measured more precisely, strongly predicts differences in women's political representation.},

	abstract = {We use data from two national surveys of married individuals-one from
   1980 and the other from 2000-to understand how three dimensions of
   marital quality changed during this period. Marital happiness and
   divorce proneness changed little between 1980 and 2000, but marital
   interaction declined significantly. A decomposition analysis suggested
   that offsetting trends affected marital quality. Increases in marital
   heterogamy, premarital cohabitation, wives' extended hours of
   employment, and wives' job demands were associated with declines in
   multiple dimensions of marital quality. In contrast, increases in
   economic resources, decision-making equality, nontraditional attitudes
   toward gender, and support for the norm of lifelong marriage were
   associated with improvements in multiple dimensions of marital quality.
   Increases in husbands' share of housework appeared to depress marital
   quality among husbands but to improve marital quality among wives.},

	abstract = {In developed western nations, both sexes commit acts of physical
   aggression against their partners. Data from 16 nations showed that this
   pattern did not generalize to all nations. The magnitude and direction
   of the sex difference was highly correlated with national-level
   variations in gender empowerment and individualism-collectivism. As
   gender equality and individualism increased, the sex difference in
   partner violence moved in the direction of lesser female victimization
   and greater male victimization. A second analysis of 52 nations showed
   that 3 indexes of women's victimization were also inversely correlated
   with gender equality and individualism. Sexist attitudes and relative
   approval of wife beating were also associated with women's victimization
   rates, but general levels of violent crime were not. The findings are
   discussed in terms of a social role approach to variations in sex
   differences between cultures.},

   division of household labor in 22 countries. First, women do more
   routine housework than men in all countries. Second, married couples
   that cohabited before marriage have a more equal division of housework.
   Third, national cohabitation rates have equalizing effects on couples
   regardless of their own cohabitation experience. However, the influence
   of cohabitation rates is only observed in countries with higher levels
   of overall gender equality. The authors conclude that the trend toward
   increasing cohabitation may be part of a broader social trend toward a

	abstract = {This article examines attitudes related to feminism and gender equality
   by evaluating the trends in, and determinants of, women and men's
   attitudes from 1974 to 1998. Past accounts suggest two clusters of
   explanations based on interests and exposure. Using these, we examine
   opinions on abortion, sexual behavior, public sphere gender roles, and
   family responsibilities. We find that attitudes have continued to
   liberalize and converge with the exception of abortion attitudes. The
   determinants of feminist opinion vary across domains, but have been
   largely stable. While not identical, the predictors Of men and women's
   opinions are similar. The results suggest the need for more attention to
   the mechanisms underlying the production of feminist opinions and
   theoretical integration of both interests and exposure in a dynamic
   process.},

	abstract = {The contours and correlates of sex segregation in higher education are
   explored using data from twelve advanced industrialized countries.
   Tertiary sex segregation is examined across two dimensions: field of
   study (horizontal segregation) and tertiary level (vertical
   segregation). The authors argue that the different aspects of female
   status in higher education (e.g., overall enrollments, representation at
   the postgraduate level, and representation in traditionally
   male-dominated fields of study) do not covary because each variable is
   affected in distinct ways by structural and cultural features commonly
   associated with ``modernity.{''} In particular, (1) ideals of
   universalism do more to undermine vertical segregation than horizontal
   segregation, and (2) some modem structural features may actually
   exacerbate specific forms of sex segregation. Consistent with these
   arguments, results suggest strongly integrative effects of
   gender-egalitarian cultural attitudes on distributions across tertiary
   levels, and weaker less uniform cultural effects on distributions across
   fields of study (one notable exception being a strong positive effect on
   women's representation in engineering programs). Two modem structural
   features-diversified tertiary systems and high rates of female
   employment-show segregative effects in some fields and institutional
   sectors. Overall, few across-the-board integrative or segregative
   effects can be discerned that would lend support to evolutionary
   conceptualizations of gender stratification. Modern cultural and
   structural pressures are manifested unevenly and in contextually
   contingent ways.},

@article{Craig2011,
	abstract = {In most families today, childcare remains divided unequally between
   fathers and mothers. Scholars argue that persistence of the gendered
   division of childcare is due to multiple causes, including values about
   gender and family, disparities in paid work, class, and social context.
   It is likely that all of these factors interact, but to date researchers
   have not explored such interactions. To address this gap, we analyze
   nationally representative time-use data from Australia, Denmark, France,
   and Italy. These countries have different employment patterns, social
   and family policies, and cultural attitudes toward parenting and gender
   equality. Using data from matched married couples, we conduct a
   cross-national study of mothers' and fathers' relative time in
   childcare, divided along dimensions of task (i.e., routine versus
   non-routine activities) and co-presence (i.e., caring for children
   together as a couple versus caring solo). Results show that mothers' and
   fathers' work arrangements and education relate modestly to shares of
   childcare, and this relationship differs across countries. We find
   cross-national variation in whether more equal shares result from the
   behavior of mothers, fathers, or both spouses. Results illustrate the
   relevance of social context in accentuating or minimizing the impact of
   individual- and household-level characteristics.},

@article{Devroe2018,
	abstract = {On the basis of a candidate's sex, voters ascribe particular personality
   traits, capacities, and opinions to candidates (often to the detriment
   of women), which are referred to as political gender stereotypes. The
   prevalence of political gender stereotypes has almost exclusively been
   investigated in the United States. As the presence of these stereotypes
   is highly dependent on contextual factors, we switch the context and
   investigate whether they are also present in a List-Proportional
   Representation (PR) system with a high share of women in parliament
   spread over different parties. The results of our experimental study,
   conducted in Flanders (Belgium), provide evidence for the existence of
   stereotypical patterns. The differences in perceived issue competence
   are, however, rather small and not always unequivocal, but larger
   differences were found in terms of ideological position. This leads us
   to conclude that misperceptions about women's ideological orientation
   might be persistent and difficult to overcome. Moreover, our results
   demonstrate that the argument that female politicians are perceived as
   more leftist because they disproportionately belong to leftist parties
   does not hold, as female politicians are rather equally spread over the
   different parties in Belgium.},

	abstract = {A theory of sexism as ambivalence, not just hostility, toward women is
   presented. Ambivalent Sexism Theory distinguishes between hostile and
   `'benevolent'' sexism (each addresses issues of power, gender
   differentiation, and sexuality). Benevolent sexism encompasses
   subjectively positive (for the sexist) attitudes toward women in
   traditional roles: protective paternalism, idealization of women, and
   desire for intimate relations. Hostile sexism encompasses the negative
   equivalents on each dimension: dominative paternalism, derogatory
   beliefs, and heterosexual hostility. Both forms of sexism serve to
   justify and maintain patriarchy and traditional gender roles. The
   validity of a measure of these constructs, the Ambivalent Sexism
   Inventory (ASI), is reviewed. Comparisons are offered between the ASI
   and other measures of sexist attitudes (e.g., the AWS), with suggestions
   for the proper domains of different scales.},

	abstract = {The equation of prejudice with antipathy is challenged by recent
   research on sexism. Benevolent sexism (a subjectively favorable,
   chivalrous ideology that offers protection and affection to women who
   embrace conventional roles) coexists with hostile sexism (antipathy
   toward women who are viewed as usurping men's power). The Ambivalent
   Sexism Inventory, first validated in U.S. samples, has been administered
   to over 15,000 men and women in 19 nations. Hostile and benevolent
   sexism are complementary, cross-culturally prevalent ideologies, both of
   which predict gender inequality. Women, as compared with men,
   consistently reject hostile sexism but often endorse benevolent sexism
   (especially in the most sexist cultures). By rewarding women for
   conforming to a patriarchal status quo, benevolent sexism inhibits
   gender equality. More generally, affect toward minority groups is often
   ambivalent, but subjectively positive stereotypes are not necessarily
   benign.},

   gender ideology as a unidimensional construct ranging from traditional
   to egalitarian is problematic and propose an alternative framework that
   takes the multidimensionality of gender ideologies into account. Using
   latent class analysis, they operationalize their gender ideology
   framework based on data from the 2008 European Values Study, of which
   eight European countries reflecting the spectrum of current work-family
   policies were selected. The authors examine the form in which gender
   ideologies cluster in the various countries. Five ideology profiles were
   identified: egalitarian, egalitarian essentialism, intensive parenting,
   moderate traditional, and traditional. The five ideology profiles were
   found in all countries, but with pronounced variation in size.
   Ideologies mixing gender essentialist and egalitarian views appear to
   have replaced traditional ideologies, even in countries offering some
   institutional support for gendered separate spheres.},

@article{Hannum2009,
	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the gender gap in education in rural
   northwest China. We first discuss parental perceptions of abilities and
   appropriate roles for girls and boys; parental concerns about old-age
   support; and parental perceptions of different labor market outcomes for
   girls' and boys' education. We then investigate gender disparities in
   investments in children, children's performance at school, and
   children's subsequent attainment. We analyze a survey of 9-12-year-old
   children and their families conducted in rural Gansu Province in the
   year 2000, along with follow-up information about subsequent educational
   attainment collected 7 years later. We complement our main analysis with
   two illustrative case studies of rural families drawn from 11 months of
   fieldwork conducted in rural Gansu between 2003 and 2005 by the second
   author.
   In 2000, most mothers expressed egalitarian views about girls' and boys'
   rights and abilities, in the abstract. However, the vast majority of
   mothers still expected to rely on sons for old-age support, and nearly
   one in five mothers interviewed agreed with the traditional saying,
   ``Sending girls to school is useless since they will get married and
   leave home.{''} Compared to boys, girls faced somewhat lower (though
   still very high) maternal educational expectations and a greater
   likelihood of being called on for household chores. However, there was
   little evidence of a gender gap in economic investments in education.
   Girls rivaled or outperformed boys in academic performance and
   engagement. Seven years later, boys had attained just about a third of a
   year more schooling than girls-a quite modest advantage that could not
   be fully explained by early parental attitudes and investments, or
   student performance or engagement. Fieldwork confirmed that parents of
   sons and daughters tended to have high aspirations for their children.
   Parents sometimes viewed boys as having greater aptitude, but tended to
   view girls as having more dedication-an attribute parents perceived as
   being critical for educational success. Findings suggest that at least
   in Gansu, rural parental educational attitudes and practices toward boys
   and girls are more complicated and less uniformly negative for girls
   than commonly portrayed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hentschel2019,
	abstract = {We used a multi-dimensional framework to assess current stereotypes of
   men and women. Specifically, we sought to determine (1) how men and
   women are characterized by male and female raters, (2) how men and women
   characterize themselves, and (3) the degree of convergence between
   self-characterizations and charcterizations of one's gender group. In an
   experimental study, 628 U.S. male and female raters described men,
   women, or themselves on scales representing multiple dimensions of the
   two defining features of gender stereotypes, agency and communality:
   assertiveness, independence, instrumental competence, leadership
   competence (agency dimensions), and concern for others, sociability and
   emotional sensitivity (communality dimensions). Results indicated that
   stereotypes about communality persist and were equally prevalent for
   male and female raters, but agency characterizations were more complex.
   Male raters generally descibed women as being less agentic than men and
   as less agentic than female raters described them. However, female
   raters differentiated among agency dimensions and described women as
   less assertive than men but as equally independent and leadership
   competent. Both male and female raters rated men and women equally high
   on instrumental competence. Gender stereotypes were also evident in
   self-characterizations, with female raters rating themselves as less
   agentic than male raters and male raters rating themselves as less
   communal than female raters, although there were exceptions (no
   differences in instrumental competence, independence, and sociability
   self-ratings for men and women). Comparisons of self-ratings and ratings
   of men and women in general indicated that women tended to characterize
   themselves in more stereotypic terms - as less assertive and less
   competent in leadership - than they characterized others in their gender
   group. Men, in contrast, characterized themselves in less stereotypic
   terms -as more communal. Overall, our results show that a focus on
   facets of agency and communality can provide deeper insights about
   stereotype content than a focus on overall agency and communality.},

	abstract = {This report examines the linkages between wife-beating and one
   health-related consequence for women, their experience of fetal and
   infant mortality. Community-based data are used drawn from women
   surveyed in two culturally distinct sites of rural India: Uttar Pradesh
   in the north, in which gender relations are highly stratified, and Tamil
   Nadu in the south, in which they are more egalitarian. Results suggest
   that wife-beating is deeply entrenched, that attitudes uniformly justify
   wife-beating and that few women can escape an abusive marriage. They
   also suggest that the health consequences of domestic violence-in terms
   of pregnancy loss and infant mortality-are considerable and that Indian
   women's experience of infant and fetal mortality is powerfully
   conditioned by the strength of the patriarchal social system. Results
   are tentative because of data limitations, but they are consistent and
   strong enough to warrant concern. They argue for the integration of
   services to identify, refer, and prevent domestic violence in the
   primary or reproductive health programs of the country and for the safe
   motherhood programs to be particularly vigilant, sensitive, and
   responsive to the conditions of battered women during pregnancy and the

	abstract = {This study examines the role that culture plays in the way individuals
   learn. Experiential learning theory is used to describe the learning
   process and the Kolb Learning Style Inventory is used to assess
   differences in how individuals learn. Using the framework for
   categorizing cultural differences from the Global Leadership and
   Organizational Effectiveness (GLOBE) study, national cultures are
   examined by cultural Clusters and individual cultural dimensions. The
   first part of the study assesses the relative influence of culture in
   comparison to gender, age, level of education and area of specialization
   of 533 respondents born in and Currently residing in 7 nations. We found
   that a significant portion of the variance in the preference for
   abstract conceptualization was explained by culture, gender, level of
   education and area of specialization. The variability in preference for
   active experimentation over reflective observation was accounted for by
   age and area of specialization. The impact of culture was only
   marginally significant. In the second part of the study where we
   examined the influence of individual Culture dimensions in shaping the
   learning style preferences, we discovered that individuals tend to have
   a more abstract learning style in countries that are high in in-group
   collectivism, institutional collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, future
   orientation and gender egalitarianism. Individuals may have a more
   reflective learning style in countries that are high in in-group
   collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and assertiveness. (C) 2008 Elsevier

   is analyzed using data from the 1987/1988 and 1992/1994 waves of the
   National Survey of Families and Households. Results indicate that
   egalitarian women are less likely to intend to have a child and actually
   to have a child than traditional women. Unlike women, egalitarian men
   are more likely to intend to have a child and less likely to divorce
   than traditional men. Single men with egalitarian attitudes are more
   likely to cohabit than their traditional counterparts. The gap between
   traditional women and traditional men in divorce, fertility intentions,
   and fertility outcomes is significant.},

@article{Knight2017,
	abstract = {This article challenges the implicit assumption of many cross-national
   studies that gender-role attitudes fall along a single continuum between
   traditional and egalitarian. The authors argue that this approach
   obscures theoretically important distinctions in attitudes and renders
   analyses of change over time incomplete. Using latent class analysis,
   they investigate the multidimensional nature of gender-role attitudes in
   17 postindustrial European countries. They identify three distinct
   varieties of egalitarianism that they designate as liberal
   egalitarianism, egalitarian familism, and flexible egalitarianism. They
   show that while traditional gender-role attitudes have precipitously and
   uniformly declined in accordance with the rising tide narrative toward
   greater egalitarianism, the relative prevalence of different
   egalitarianisms varies markedly across countries. Furthermore, they find
   that European nations are not converging toward one dominant egalitarian
   model but rather, remain differentiated by varieties of egalitarianism.},

   sexual well-being, explored its various aspects, examined predictors

   well-being (the emotional and physical satisfaction of sexual
   relationships, satisfaction with sexual health or function, and the
   importance of sex in one's life) was explored using cluster analysis,
   and relationships among sexual well-being, general happiness, and
   various correlates were examined using ordinary least squares regression
   and ordered logistic regression. Results from the cluster analysis
   identified three clusters: a gender-equal regime and two male-centered
   regimes. Despite this cultural variation, the predictors of subjective

   this change occurred within cohorts than through cohort succession. With
   the exception of college-graduate women, whose support for gender
   equality was high at both periods, the profeminist trend occurred about
   equally in all sociodemographic subgroups of the population; although

@article{Minkov2018,
	abstract = {Purpose Hofstede's model of national culture has enjoyed enormous
   popularity but rests partly on faith. It has never been fully replicated
   and its predictive properties have been challenged. The purpose of this
   paper is to provide a test of the model's coherence and utility.
   Design/methodology/approach Analyses of secondary data, including the
   World Values Survey, and a new survey across 56 countries represented by
   nearly 53,000 probabilistically selected respondents.
   Findings Improved operationalizations of individualism-collectivism
   (IDV-COLL) suggest it is a robust dimension of national culture. A
   modern IDV-COLL index supersedes Hofstede's 50 year-old original one.
   Power distance (PD) seems to be a logical facet of IDV-COLL, rather than
   an independent dimension. Uncertainty avoidance (UA) lacks internal
   reliability. Approval of restrictive societal rules and laws is a facet
   of COLL and is not associated with national anxiety or neuroticism. UA
   is not a predictor of any of its presumed main correlates: importance of
   job security, preference for a safe job, trust, racism and xenophobia,
   subjective well-being, innovation, and economic freedom. The dimension
   of masculinity-femininity (MAS-FEM) lacks coherence. MAS and FEM job
   goals and broader values are correlated positively, not negatively, and
   are not related to the MAS-FEM index. MAS-FEM is not a predictor of any
   of its presumed main correlates: achievement and competition
   orientation, help and compassion, preference for a workplace with
   likeable people, work orientation, religiousness, gender egalitarianism,
   foreign aid. After a radical reconceptualization and a new
   operationalization, the so-called fifth dimension (CWD or long-term
   orientation) becomes more coherent and useful. The new version, called
   flexibility-monumentalism (FLX-MON), explains the cultural differences
   between East Asian Confucian societies at one extreme and Latin America
   plus Africa at the other, and is the best predictor of national
   differences in educational achievement.
   Research limitations/implications Differences between subsidiaries of a
   multinational company, such as IBM around 1970, are not necessarily a
   good source of knowledge about broad cultural differences. A model of
   national culture must be validated across a large number of countries
   from all continents and its predictions should withstand various
   plausible controls. Much of Hofstede's model (UA, MAS-FEM) fails this
   test while the remaining part (IDV-COLL, PD, LTO) needs a serious
   revision.
   Practical implications Consultancies and business schools still teach
   Hofstede's model uncritically. They need to be aware of its
   deficiencies.
   Originality/value As UA and MAS-FEM are apparently misleading artifacts
   of Hofstede's IBM data set, a thorough revision of Hofstede's model is
   proposed, reducing it to two dimensions: IDV-COLL and FLX-MON.},

	abstract = {Using data from a national probability sample of heterosexual U.S.
   adults (N=2,281), the present study describes the distribution and

   Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly
   correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but
   were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people
   were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes
   were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender;
   higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism,
   and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of
   personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual
   prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes,
   but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism,
   anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant
   predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications
   and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender

@article{Pedulla2015,
	abstract = {Why has progress toward gender equality in the workplace and at home
   stalled in recent decades? A growing body of scholarship suggests that
   persistently gendered workplace norms and policies limit men's and
   women's ability to create gender egalitarian relationships at home. In
   this article, we build on and extend prior research by examining the
   extent to which institutional constraints, including workplace policies,
   affect young, unmarried men's and women's preferences for their future
   work-family arrangements. We also examine how these effects vary across
   education levels. Drawing on original survey-experimental data, we ask
   respondents how they would like to structure their future relationships
   while experimentally manipulating the degree of institutional constraint
   under which they state their preferences. Two clear patterns emerge.
   First, as constraints are removed and men and women can opt for an
   egalitarian relationship, the majority choose this option, regardless of
   gender or education level. Second, women's relationship structure
   preferences are more responsive than men's to the removal of
   institutional constraints through supportive work-family policy
   interventions. These findings shed light on important questions about
   the role of institutions in shaping work-family preferences,
   underscoring the notion that seemingly gender-traditional work-family
   decisions are largely contingent on the constraints of current
   workplaces.},

@article{Reichelt2021,
	abstract = {COVID-19 and ensuing changes in mobility have altered employment
   relations for millions of people across the globe. Emerging evidence
   shows that women may be more severely affected by this change. The
   pandemic, however, may have an impact beyond the immediate restructuring
   of employment and shift gender-role attitudes within households as a
   result of changes in the division of household labor. We analyze a
   representative sample of respondents in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore
   and show that transitions to unemployment, reductions in working hours
   and transitions to working from home have been more frequent for women
   than for men - although not to the same extent across the three
   countries. We also demonstrate that among couples who had been employed
   at the start of the pandemic, men express more egalitarian gender-role
   attitudes if they became unemployed but their partners remained
   employed, while women express more traditional attitudes if they became
   unemployed and their partners remained employed. These results indicate
   that gender-role attitudes might adapt to the lived realities. The
   long-term consequences will depend on how both men and women experience
   further shifts in their employment relations as economies recover.},

@article{Scarborough2019,
	abstract = {Empirical studies show that though there is more room for improvement,
   much progress has been made toward gender equality since the second wave
   of feminism. Evidence also suggests that women's advancements have been
   more dramatic in the public sphere of work and politics than in the
   private sphere of family life. We argue that this lopsided gender
   progress may be traced to uneven changes in gender attitudes. Using data
   from more than 27,000 respondents who participated in the General Social
   Survey from 1977 through 2016, we show that gender attitudes have more
   than one underlying dimension and that these dimensions have changed at
   different rates over time. Using latent class analysis, we find that the
   distribution of respondents' attitudes toward gender equality has
   changed over the past 40 years. There has been an increase in the number
   of egalitarians who support equality in public and private spheres,
   while the traditionals who historically opposed equality in both domains
   have been replaced by ambivalents who feel differently about gender
   equality in the public and private spheres. Meanwhile, successive birth
   cohorts are becoming more egalitarian, with Generation-Xers and
   Millennials being the most likely to hold strong egalitarian views. The
   feminist revolution has succeeded in promoting egalitarian views and
   decreasing the influence of gender traditionalism, but has yet to
   convince a substantial minority that gender equality should extend to
   both public and private spheres of social life},

   15-item form of the Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS; Spence \&
   Helmreich, 1972a, 1978) were compared for students at the same
   university tested in 1972, 1976, 1980, and 1992. In both males and
   females, members of the 1992 cohort were the most egalitarian, and
   members of the 1972 cohort were the least egalitarian. In all groups,
   women were significantly less traditional in their attitudes than men.
   As has been found in previous studies, detailed analyses of the data
   from the 1992 cohort revealed that the scale was unifactorial, but that
   the score distributions were skewed. There was also some indication of
   ceiling effects at the egalitarian end of the scale, particularly in
   women. The implications of these latter results for the usefulness of
   the AWS in current research were explored.},

@article{Thornton2001,
	abstract = {This article examines trends in family attitudes and values across the
   last 4 decades of the 20th century, with particular emphasis on the past
   2 decades. The article focuses on attitudes toward a wide range of
   family issues, including the roles of men and women, marriage, divorce,
   childlessness, premarital sex, extramarital sex, unmarried cohabitation,
   and unmarried childbearing. More generally, the article considers trends
   in 3 broad contemporary values: freedom; equality; and commitment to
   family, marriage, and children. Five data sets are used for the article:
   Monitoring the Future, General Social Survey, International Social
   Science Project, Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children,
   and the National Survey, of Families and Households. These 5 data sets
   reveal substantial and persistent long-term trends toward the
   endorsement of gender equality in families, which may have plateaued at
   very high levels in recent years. There have also been important and
   continuing long-term trends toward individual autonomy and tolerance
   toward a diversity of personal and family behaviors as reflected in
   increased acceptance of divorce, premarital sex, unmarried cohabitation,
   remaining single, and choosing to be childless. At the same time,
   marriage and family life remain important in the cultural ethos, with
   large and relatively stable fractions of young people believing that
   marriage and family life are important and planning marriage and the
   bearing and rearing of children.},

	abstract = {The companionate theory of marriage suggests that egalitarianism in
   practice and belief leads to higher marital quality for wives and higher
   levels of positive emotion work on the part of husbands. Our analysis of
   women's marital quality and men's marital emotion work provides little
   evidence in support of this theory. Rather, in examining women's marital
   quality and men's emotional investments in marriage, we find that dyadic
   commitment to institutional ideals about marriage and women's
   contentment with the division of household tasks are more critical. We
   also show that men's marital emotion work is a very important
   determinant of women's marital quality. We conclude by noting that
   ``her{''} marriage is happiest when it combines elements of the new and
   old: that is, gender equity and normative commitment to the institution
   of marriage.},

   authors argue that even weakly enforced laws can contribute to positive
   social change. They theorize the expressive power of VAW legislation,
   and present evidence for a cautiously optimistic assessment of current
   trends on violence against women and the ways that VAW laws affect
   social norms. Focusing on a time of major legal change related to VAW in
   Mexico, this article explores trends in behavior and attitudes related
   to violence by analyzing four waves of the National Survey on the
   Dynamics of Household Relations (ENDIREH), which include detailed
   interviews with thousands of Mexican women. The authors find that over
   this period, the share of women experiencing intimate-partner abuse
   declined, attitudes condoning violence shifted, reporting rates rose,
   and most women learned about legislation to protect their rights. These
   changes are consistent with the authors' expectations about the
   expressive power of anti-violence legislation.},

	abstract = {Intersectionality scholars have long identified dynamic configurations
   of race and gender ideologies. Yet, survey research on racial and gender
   attitudes tends to treat these components as independent. We apply
   latent class analysis to a set of racial and gender attitude items from
   the General Social Survey (1977 to 2018) to identify four configurations
   of individuals' simultaneous views on race and gender. Two of these
   configurations hold unified progressive or regressive racial and gender
   attitudes. The other two formations have discordant racial and gender
   attitudes, where progressive views on one aspect combine with regressive
   views on the other. In the majority of survey years, the most commonly
   held configuration endorsed gender equality but espoused new racialist
   views that attributed racial disparities to cultural deficiencies. This
   perspective has become increasingly common since 1977 and is most
   prevalent among White women and White men, likely due to racial-group
   interest. Black women and Black men, in contrast, are more likely to
   embrace progressive racial and gender attitudes. We argue that White
   men's gender egalitarianism may be rooted in self-interest, aimed at
   acquiring resources through intimate relationships. In contrast, Black
   men adopt progressive racial and gender attitudes to form a necessary
   coalition with Black women to challenge racism.},

	abstract = {Previous research on support for gender quotas focuses on attitudes
   toward gender equality and government intervention as explanations. We
   argue the role of attitudes toward women in understanding support for
   policies aiming to increase the presence of women in politics is
   ambivalent-both hostile and benevolent forms of sexism contribute in
   understanding support, albeit in different ways. Using original data
   from a survey conducted on a probability-based sample of Australian
   respondents, our findings demonstrate that hostile sexists are more
   likely to oppose increasing of women's presence in politics through the
   adoption of gender quotas. Benevolent sexists, on the other hand, are
   more likely to support these policies than respondents exhibiting low
   levels of benevolent sexism. We argue this is because benevolent sexism
   holds that women are pure and need protection; they do not have what it
   takes to succeed in politics without the assistance of quotas. Finally,
   we show that while women are more likely to support quotas, ambivalent
   sexism has the same relationship with support among both women and men.
   These findings suggest that aggregate levels of public support for
   gender quotas do not necessarily represent greater acceptance of gender
   equality generally.},

	abstract = {Public debates depict Arabs as opposed to gender equality because of
   Islam. However, there may be substantial numbers of Arab Muslims who do
   support feminist issues and who do so while being highly attached to
   Islam. This study explains why certain Arabs support feminism while
   remaining strongly religious ({''}Muslim feminists{''}). We propose that
   some Arab citizens are more likely to subvert patriarchal norms,
   especially in societies that construct Islam and feminism as more
   compatible. Empirically, we apply three-level multinomial analyses to 51
   Arab Barometer and World Values Surveys, which include 57,000 Arab
   Muslims. Our results show that one in four Arab Muslims supports Muslim
   feminism-far more than those who support a more secularist version of
   feminism. Employed women, single people, people who distrust
   institutions, and more highly educated people support Muslim feminism
   more than do others-especially in societies that construct feminism and
   Islam as less contradictory, such as those with strong feminist
   movements. The presumption that Islam and feminism are necessarily
   opposed may hinder feminism. A more effective way to boost gender
   equality in the Arab region may be to embolden emancipatory religious
   interpretations.},

	abstract = {Are appeals to discredit mainstream media reporting of political news in
   the guise of ``fake news{''} merely a diversion from more fundamental
   threats to democratic politics and policymaking? Or is the emerging
   belief in ``fake news{''} itself a looming threat? Using data from the
   Voter Study Group's panel survey, we examine the relationship between
   disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and
   policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump's
   election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent
   of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established
   foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are
   especially pronounced on key elements of Trump's rhetoric as candidate
   and as president-hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious
   minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America's ``greatness,{''}
   and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also
   find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has
   become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend
   the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of
   American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key
   component.},

   opinion polls on gender stereotypes (N = 30,093 adults), extending from
   1946 to 2018, a span of seven decades that brought considerable change
   in gender relations, especially in women's roles. In polls inquiring
   about communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g.,
   ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative),
   respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men,
   or equally true of both. Women's relative advantage in communion
   increased over time, but men's relative advantage in agency showed no
   change. Belief in competence equality increased over time, along with
   belief in female superiority among those who indicated a sex difference
   in competence. Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial
   female advantage in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but
   also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage.
   Interpretation emphasizes the origins of gender stereotypes in the

@article{Pereira2020,
	abstract = {Research on public opinion towards affirmative action shows that
   citizens often support the principle of equality while simultaneously
   rejecting policies that promote it in a pattern described as the
   ``principle-policy puzzle.{''} The scholarship also shows that ideology
   and prejudice towards the targeted group explain the puzzle with respect
   to racial affirmative action. In this article, we use unique survey
   questions included in the 2014 round of the AmericasBarometer in Brazil
   to show that citizens tend to support electoral gender quotas while
   rejecting gender-based egalitarianism in a reversed version of the
   ``principle-policy puzzle.{''} We argue that a different type of gender
   attitudes, namely benevolent sexism, shapes support for gender quotas as
   well as for the principle of equality. While benevolent sexists tend to
   reject gender equality based on views about gender complementarity and
   stereotypes about women's purity, they also support quotas as policies
   to foster such values. Our findings suggest that even though the
   political and scholarly debates can provide sound normative reasons for
   the adoption of quotas across different contexts, public support for
   them often relies on paternalistic views and expectations about the role
   of women in politics.},

   support for affirmative action policies in the economy using the example
   of gender quotas for company boards. In contrast to previous studies, we
   focus on the contextual level and analyse how factors related to
   political institutions and actors, and economic and social structure
   shape citizens' support and the gap in support between men and women. We
   apply multilevel regression analyses of Eurobarometer data for 27
   European countries. Levels of support and gender gaps in support for
   boardroom quotas vary largely between countries. Contextual factors
   related to existing quota laws, gender equality in social and economic
   life, and public opinion towards state intervention are important
   determinants of cross-national variation. Our results point to an
   ambiguous relationship of support for gender quotas and actual gender
   equality in a country. Citizens' endorsement of quotas is low in
   countries with high levels of formal gender equality. Support is higher
   in countries where interventionist policies are widely accepted. Also,
   existing quota laws are positively related to citizens' support of

@article{Glas2019,
	abstract = {Previous public opinion studies argued that in the Arab Middle East and
   North Africa (MENA) Muslim citizens support gender equality less than
   non-Muslims, due to Islamic-patriarchal socialization. Deviating from
   this Orientalist narrative, we formulate a context-dependent
   agentic-socialization framework, which acknowledges religiosity's and
   gender equality's multidimensionality along with the MENA's
   political-institutional diversity. We expect that religious service
   attendance and devotion decrease support for gender equality in politics
   but not in education. Moreover, we theorize that open political
   structures allow citizens to express agency and dissociate from dominant
   patriarchal patterns. We test these expectations using WVS and AB data
   covering 50,000 respondents in 39 MENA country-years. Our results show
   religious service attendance indeed reduces support for gender equality.
   However, more devoted citizens support gender equality in education more
   than the less devoted, and in more democratic polities and in polities
   with more freedom of press, the same is found for political gender
   equality. Moreover, support for gender equality is greater in open
   polities than closed ones, but this gap closes when people frequent
   religious services. These results suggest MENA citizens are not
   univocally passively socialized by patriarchal religious views, but
   actively engage with other interpretations, provided these are not
   banned by oppressive governments.},

   complex, eluding the simple dichotomy between prima facie support and
   second order incongruence with democracy, which characterises current
   debates. Respondents have a more holistic understanding of democracy
   than is found in current scholarship or indeed pursued by Western or
   regional policymakers, valuing civil-political rights but prioritizing
   socio-economic rights. There is broad consensus behind principles of
   gender equality, but indirect questions reveal the continuing influence
   of conservative and patriarchal attitudes. Respondents value religion,
   but do not trust religious leaders or want them to meddle in elections
   or government. Moreover, while there is broad support for
   conventionally-understood pillars of liberal democracy (free elections,
   a parliamentary system), there is also a significant gap between those
   who support democracy as the best political system in principle and
   those who also believe it is actually suitable for their country.},

@article{Glas2018,
	abstract = {Much is said about Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) publics
   opposing gender equality, often referring to patriarchal Islam. However,
   nuanced large-scale studies addressing which specific aspects of
   religiosity affect support for gender equality across the MENA are
   conspicuously absent. This study develops and tests a gendered agentic
   socialization framework that proposes that MENA citizens are not only
   passively socialized by religion but also have agency (within their
   religiosity). This disaggregates the influence of religiosity,
   highlights its multifacetedness, and theorizes the moderating roles that
   gender and sociocognitive empowerment play via gendered processes of
   agentic dissociations. Using 15 World Values Surveys and multilevel
   models, our analyses show that most dimensions of religiosity fuel
   opposition to gender equality. However, the salience of religion in
   daily life is found to increase women's support for gender equality and
   cushion the negative impact of religious service attendance. Also,
   gender and education moderate the impacts of several religiosity
   dimensions; for instance, women's (initially greater) support for gender
   equality more sharply declines with increased service attendance than
   men's. Altogether, this study finds that religious socialization is
   multifaceted and gendered, and that certain men and women are inclined
   and equipped to deviate from dominant patriarchal religious
   interpretations.},

@article{Sharrow2018,
	abstract = {An extensive literature on the politics of the family suggests that
   familial relationships play a central role in individuals' political
   socialization and can ultimately shape one's policy preferences. A
   current debate within this literature deals with the impact of daughters
   on fathers' political attitudes. In this article, we address this debate
   in relation to a specific set of policy preferences and ask: Does the
   experience of fathering daughters affect men's opinions toward
   gender-equality policies? In addressing this question, this study
   examines three theoretically motivated propositions: first, that having
   a daughter leads men to see the benefits of and support public policies
   that aim to reduce gender inequality; second, that fathers with a larger
   proportion of daughters express stronger support for these policies; and
   finally, that having a daughter as a man's first child is a critical
   event in the political socialization of men, such that this experience
   of ``first-daughterhood{''} will lead to higher levels of support for
   gender-equality policies. We use original representative survey data
   from a module on the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study
   (CCES) to test these three hypotheses. The results of our analyses
   suggest that the experience of having a daughter as a first child-but
   not the effect of having a daughter in general nor the experience of
   fathering a higher proportion of daughters-significantly increases
   fathers' support for policies designed to increase gender equality.},

@article{Wood2018,
	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that patriarchal structures and rigid gender
   hierarchies at the societal level increase a country's propensity for
   involvement in violent social and political conflict. While examining
   macrolevel predictors and outcomes, the arguments put forth in these
   studies rely heavily on theories linking individuals' attitudes toward
   gender equality to individuals' beliefs in the appropriateness of
   violence as a. means of attaining political or social objectives. In
   this research, we explore the inicrofoundations of the gender equality
   peace thesis by examining the conditional impact of beliefs about gender
   egalitarianism on support for the use of force to achieve foreign policy
   objectives. Using data from a nationally representative survey of US
   citizens, we find that as the strength of gender egalitarian attitudes
   increases, respondents' support for the use of force to achieve
   traditional security objectives declines. Importantly, however, our
   results suggest that gender egalitarian attitudes exert the strongest
   suppressive effect on support for the use force among male respondents:
   rising gender egalitarianism among men effectively closes the gender gap
   in support for the use of force. Consequently, these results provide
   microlevel support for the relationship between gender equality and
   peace found in macrolevel observational analyses.},

	abstract = {The percentage of women elected in the Australian Parliament is
   comparatively low. This poor track record has generated debate within
   political parties about the necessity of gender quotas (or targets) to
   increase women's representation. Using the 2016 Australian Election
   Study, this paper proposes to test support for different measures aiming
   to increasing women's representation in Australian politics. More
   specifically, I investigate the role of partisanship in explaining
   gender differences in support for gender quotas. I find that differences
   in support for quotas are greater among women, and among men, than
   between women and men. The paper also demonstrates that the role of
   political values in explaining differences in support for gender quotas
   is non-uniform. Indeed, attitudes towards government intervention,
   minority rights, and gender equality are more crucial in explaining
   differences in support for legislative quotas among men than among
   women.},

   over a 25-year span and examines the social determinants of the
   acceptability of prostitution, using structural equation modeling (SEM),
   which allows researchers to elaborate both direct and indirect effects
   (through mediating variables) on the outcome variable. Results show that
   the public has become more acceptant of prostitution over time. In
   addition, the less religious, less authoritarian, and more educated are
   more acceptant of prostitution than the more religious, more
   authoritarian, and less well educated. The effects of religiosity and
   authoritarianism mediate out the direct effects of age, gender, gender
   equality, marriage, marriage as an outdated institution, Quebec, race,
   and tolerance. The findings may serve as a reference point for the law
   reform regarding the regulation of prostitution in Canada.},

@article{Bjarnegard2017,
	abstract = {The gender gap in attitudes to foreign policy is well established in
   public opinion literature. Studies have repeatedly reported that women
   tend to be more peaceful and less militaristic than men. This article
   reexamines attitudes of individuals in relation to foreign policy and
   pits the gender gap against the largely forgotten feminist gap. We argue
   that the individual-level relationship between gender equality attitudes
   on the one hand, and tolerance and benevolence on the other, is
   under-researched, but also that key contributions about the effects of
   feminism have been mostly ignored in research on the gender gap in
   public opinion. We return to the notion of a causal relationship between
   gender equality attitudes, and peaceful attitudes, and of a feminist gap
   that also exists among men. In a series of novel empirical tests, we
   demonstrate that attitudes to gender equality, not biological sex,
   explain attitudes towards other nationalities and religious groups.
   Using individual-level survey data from five countries around the
   Pacific: China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States of
   America, we show that both men and women who reject gender equality are
   much more hostile both to other nations and to minorities in their own

@article{Smith2017,
	abstract = {What are the sources and effects of gendered leadership stereotypes for
   women's representation? We explore the role of stereotypes in shaping
   public attitudes toward women's representation using AmericasBarometer
   survey data from 25 countries. We report three key results. First, the
   modal respondent in almost every country rejects gendered leadership
   stereotypes, affirming that women and men leaders are equally qualified
   on corruption and the economy. This holds even after we attempt to
   account for social desirability bias. Second, there are significant
   individual- and country-level determinants of stereotyping. In countries
   with higher women's representation and labor force participation but
   without gender quotas, citizens are more likely to choose pro-female and
   neutral responses over pro-male stereotypes. At the individual level,
   those rejecting stereotypes are less authoritarian, more supportive of
   labor market equality, and more leftist than those reporting pro-female
   stereotypes. Third, the consequences for representation vary by
   partisanship and country context. Pro-female leadership stereotypes
   boost support for women presidential candidates and for legislative
   gender quotas, but they matter less among copartisans of women
   candidates, and they matter more when women candidates are viable but
   gendered outsiders. Those rejecting leadership stereotypes altogether
   are less supportive of quotas.},

@article{Treas2016,
	abstract = {The gendered division of housework is the linchpin in a broader system
   of gender inequality. Consistent with pioneering feminist theories of
   gender stratification, this cross-national study demonstrates this
   approach with multi-level models that consider individual as well as
   cultural and structural variables that are associated with the absolute
   time men and women spend doing housework. Building on research relating
   national gender ideology to the husband-wife shares of housework, this
   paper asks how gender ideology relates to the absolute amount of time
   that men and women spend doing housework. Complementing this cultural
   indicator, the paper introduces a previously neglected constraint on
   domestic practices, asking whether the quality of a country's housing
   stock predicts weekly hours in housework. Drawing on 2012 International
   Social Survey Program data for 20 European countries, we study
   nationally representative samples totaling 7733 respondents who were
   ages 18-65 and legally married, cohabiting, or in civil partnerships.
   Even controlling for individual-level covariates, results confirm that
   men and women perform less housework in countries where public opinion
   supports gender equality. In countries with more substandard housing,
   however, women, but not men, spend more time in housework than they do
   elsewhere.},

   gender equality and attitudes toward prostitution by employing an
   international sample of 48,630 subjects in 54 countries from the fifth

   the current mixed level logistic regression results found no fixed
   effect between an individual's gender equality attitude and attitude
   toward prostitution. However, the findings on other variables suggested
   that liberals are more likely to have a somewhat more favorable attitude
   toward prostitution than conservatives. Those who hold a higher social
   status, who are less religious, and who do not have a strong belief in
   marriage are more likely to have a somewhat favorable attitude toward
   prostitution.},

   two ways. First, we use multiple correspondence analysis in order to
   assess the different directions and the degree of (employment-oriented)
   family policy change over the past three decades in 18 rich Organisation
   for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Second, we
   perform a series of correlations to identify the core drivers of these
   developments. Our main findings-based on five international
   datasets-are: (i) we have been witnesses of a significant expansion of
   family policies over the past three decades in almost all countries
   analysed, although the degree of change (distinguished by first-,
   second- and third-order change) differs across the OECD area; and (ii)
   whilst in the 1980s and 1990s social democracy and organised women were
   key drivers of family policy expansion, during the 2000s public opinion,
   that increasingly seems to support a ``modernised{''} family lifestyle
   in which mothers are employed, seems to have played an essential role in
   explaining policy change.},

@article{Morgan2013,
	abstract = {This article outlines three theoretical arguments-socialization, status
   discontent, and elite cues-that generate competing predictions about the
   way context shapes gender attitudes. Using hierarchical analysis, we
   assess the power of these arguments in Latin America, a region that
   manifests considerable variation on our central explanatory variables
   and thus offers important theoretical leverage. We find men's gender
   attitudes to be highly contingent on elite cues and susceptible to
   backlash effects in response to women's economic advancement. Also,
   where women lack national representation, distrust of government
   promotes support for female leadership as an alternative to the
   discredited ( male) establishment. The analysis supports existing
   individual-level explanations of gender attitudes and demonstrates a
   connection between diffuse democratic values and gender egalitarianism.
   The findings suggest that recent advances for female politicians in
   Latin America may be susceptible to reversal, and they illuminate
   strategies for strengthening women's equality in the region.},

@article{Voicu2012,
	abstract = {The impact of modernization and industrialization on gender arrangements
   has been different depending on the gender culture that predominated
   when the modernization process started. Romania was among the most rural
   societies in Europe after the Second World War. Women's involvement in
   agricultural activity was very high, but the gender division of work was
   a very traditional one. The communist regimes promoted a full employment
   policy for the entire population but did nothing to encourage gender
   equality in the private space. This article focuses on the Romanian
   case, aiming to identify the dynamics of gender beliefs during the
   post-communist period. Using data from two waves of the European Values
   Survey (1990, 1999), as well as data provided by the Public Opinion
   Barometer 2007 and by Family Life 2008, the authors carried out standard
   cohort decomposition methods in order to detect the mechanism that
   produced the most variation in gender beliefs.},

@article{Cotter2011,
	abstract = {After becoming consistently more egalitarian for more than two decades,
   gender role attitudes in the General Social Survey have changed little
   since the mid-1990s. This plateau mirrors other gender trends,
   suggesting a fundamental alteration in the momentum toward gender
   equality. While cohort replacement can explain about half of the
   increasing egalitarianism between 1974 and 1994, the changes since the
   mid-1990s are not well accounted for by cohort differences. Nor is the
   post-1994 stagnation explained by structural or broad ideological
   changes in American society. The recent lack of change in gender
   attitudes is more likely the consequence of the rise of a new cultural
   frame, an ``egalitarian essentialism{''} that blends aspects of feminist
   equality and traditional motherhood roles.},

   from the 1970s onward. Nonetheless, significant and varying gender gaps
   in this support become evident when we analyze public opinion over time
   and across generations. I utilize longitudinal survey data from national
   samples of three generations that came of age in the pre-women's
   movement era, during the era, and in the postmovement era, respectively.
   Three main indicators of attitudes about gender equality are employed
   and two types of gaps are formulated. Contemporaneous gender gaps-the
   differences between men and women at a given time-tended to increase
   over time and across succeeding generations. Longitudinal gaps, the
   differences in support between men and women across generations at
   different points in time, took the form of women becoming more liberal
   than men. Signs of growing resentment or ambivalence about gender
   equality among men appeared in the postmovement generation. A
   combination of generation and period effects accounts for these
   dynamics, the key factor being the interaction of gender with
   generational location and secular tides.},

   understanding patterns of stability and change in behaviors and
   institutions related to gender. Since the early 1990s, a new generation
   of research has reported evidence linking changing gender role attitudes
   to subsequent change in the behavior of individuals and also to the
   level of gender inequality within specific institutions. While gender
   role attitudes appear to have significant effects within the context of
   family institutions, questions about the precise causal origins of these
   changing attitudes have received insufficient attention in the recent
   literature. This paper contributes to the sociological reconsideration
   of this opinion trend by evaluating competing explanations of changing
   gender role attitudes. We find evidence of substantial cohort
   replacement effects. Further analyses suggest that processes of
   ideological learning may mediate a large portion of the cohort
   replacement effect, also explaining much of the contribution of adult
   attitude change to opinion trends. We discuss implications of these
   findings for advancing the literature on gender role attitudes, and also
   for fruitfully revisiting questions about the role of ideology in US
   public opinion. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

@article{Knudsen2001,
	abstract = {This article examines how a general social process - the struggle toward
   gender equality - is reflected in the public opinion on mothers'
   employment in three different modern welfare states: Great Britain,
   Sweden and Norway. Viewing such attitudes as reponses to structural
   changes in women's relation to the labour market, the possible between-
   and within-country variations in these attitudes are hypothesized. The
   data are drawn from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and
   the results from a large cross-national survey are used. It is found
   that women are more positive than men, and that the younger, the
   better-educated and the less religious members of society are the most
   positive to mother's employment in all three countries. As for the
   between-country variations, it is found that the Swedes are the most
   positive and the Norwegians the most negative. It is suggested that
   Great Britain's longer history of industrialization and of urban married
   women's employment explains why the British people are more positive
   towards mothers' employment than Norwegians, despite the Norwegian
   welfare policies with their much stronger emphasis on supporting gender
   equality and mothers' employment.},

@article{Sapiro2001,
	abstract = {Most conceptual research on equality revolves around theoretical texts
   or legal theory and decisions, thus reflecting the thought of legal,
   political, or cultural elites. But in a democratic polity, we must
   attend to the political thought not just of politicos and academics, but
   ordinary citizens as well. In terms of its political significance,
   ``What does equality mean{''} requires answering the question: what does
   equality mean to the mass public? We thus probe the meanings of ``gender
   equality{''} in the public mind, using a unique set of questions
   included in the National Election Studies 1991 Pilot Study, and
   contextualized within the literatures of feminist and legal theory and
   political psychology and public opinion. Most importantly, we
   distinguish among ``empirical{''} and ``normative{''} equality and
   discontent and among the domains of the polity, economy, and family;
   feature the problem of ``equality{''} versus ``sameness{''}; and
   consider the relationship of these orientations to people's own
   structural circumstances and their other policy and political attitudes.
   Among the key findings, empirical and normative equality and discontent
   are functionally different and grounded differently in people's everyday
   experiences; they distinguish among different domains of life and,
   especially, between public and private; and there are generational
   differences in the relationship of ``equality{''} to ``sameness.{''} We
   discuss substantive and methodological implications.},

@article{Terkildsen1997,

   ascertain the presence of five unique frames from the 1950s through the
   1990s: a sex roles frame, a feminism frame, political rights frame,
   economic rights frame, and an anti-feminism frame. After describing the
   frames we discuss an experimental test of four of the media packages on
   voters' political attitudes using a non-random sample of adults.
   Experimental results indicate that the economic rights and anti-feminism
   frames had a strong, negative impact on subject attitudes toward gender
   equality, support for women's rights, support for non-traditional gender
   roles and the frequency with which subjects mentioned ``women's
   issues{''} as among the most important issues facing the U.S. In
   addition, the feminism frame also exerted negative effects; while,
   conversely, the political rights frame had a positive influence on
   similar gender attitudes. Results were moderated by respondent gender
   with men demonstrating greater susceptibility to issue framing than
   women.},
