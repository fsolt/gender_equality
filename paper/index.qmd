# Preface for KIRL Readers {.unnumbered}

Our manuscript has progressed since our last meeting.
Chapter 3, on measuring public opinion on gender egalitarianism; Chapter 4, on descriptive representation; and Chapter 6, on the Korean case, are well along.
The remaining chapters range from drafty to as yet nonexistent.

Nevertheless, we're excited for the manuscript's promise, and how it will continue to come together in time.

So, with apologies for its still incomplete state, we thank you for taking a look at this work.
