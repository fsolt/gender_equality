# Preface for KIRL Readers {.unnumbered}

At present, we have a bunch of pieces that have yet to be well integrated. Chapter 2, on theory, is not much more than a sketch of hypotheses, and Chapter 4, on descriptive representation, is *extremely* drafty---it's still basically the transcript of a talk.  Chapter 6, on the Korean case, is in better shape, but some of the material presented there likely goes elsewhere.

Nevertheless, we're excited for the manuscript's promise, and how it will come together in time.

So, with apologies for its current state, we thank you for taking a look at this work.
