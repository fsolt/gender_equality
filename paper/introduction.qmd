# Introduction

How do societal attitudes toward gender roles influence women's political success and policy influence?  Taking advantage of a comprehensive collection of survey data and recent advances in latent variable modeling of public opinion, this book provides new evidence of how and when public gender egalitarianism is translated into gender equality in countries around the world.  First, the work describes how public gender egalitarian attitudes--attitudes favoring gender equality in the public sphere of politics and the workplace---vary across countries and how these attitudes have changed over the past three decades.  Next, the work examines women's success in achieving political office in countries around the world, identifying the factors that allow more gender egalitarian attitudes to translate into greater women's descriptive representation in legislatures, cabinets, and chief executive's offices.  The following section turns to the adoption of gender egalitarian policies in cross-national perspective, highlighting the roles of public gender egalitarianism and descriptive representation.  The final section delves into the legislative process within the Korean National Assembly to further explore the ways in which gender egalitarian attitudes are, and are not, converted into political outcomes that further gender equality.  The book will shed new light on the conditions in which policymakers take the public's views on egalitarian gender roles into account.
