## Implications for the Study of Public Opinion

Scholars of public opinion have long argued that democratic representation depends on the _salience_ of the issue, that is, "its importance to the public and its prominence in public discourse" [@Lax2012, 157; see also, e.g., @Page1983].

@Wlezien2004 [, 8] argues instead that "From the point of view of representation in different domains, what matters is importance" rather than salience.^[
@Wlezien2004 [, 8] makes this point in regard to 
]
In light of the fact that representation may occur through adaptation as well as by selection [per @Caughey2022, 99]; there is no need to expect an issue's representation to depend on its politicization by parties and a resulting prominence in political discourse.

contrary to those who  that an issue need not be considered a problem, or the _most_ important to the public.

^[
]
The evidence an issue is important is when public opinion responds to what policymakers do
Here, too, given that we find 

Representation: conditions
how--selection and adaptation

@Soss2007 [, 121] suggests that public responsiveness in the form of accelerating feedback should be expected when policies are both (a) visible rather than obscure and (b) tangible in people's lives as opposed to distant in geographic, social, or temporal terms.
Women in office and policies advancing gender equality are the opposite of obscure: they attract attention by challenging the masculine status quo of the public sphere in very visible ways that provoke a response [cf. @Weeks2022].
Highly tangible policies are those most citizens personally experience on a recurrent basis.
Such policies define target populations by expanding or protecting citizens' rights; educate the public about what is socially acceptable by reshaping norms; and, by clearly linking the policy's effects to government action, generate additional support for analogous policies [@Pacheco2013, 716-718].
In a world in which the public sphere is traditionally dominated by men, policies advancing gender equality in politics and employment are undoubtedly tangible in this sense as well.
Our results neatly align with the prediction that positive feedback should occur in such circumstances.^[
It should also be noted that @Soss2007 [, 122], while briefly alluding to the possibility of "more complicated feedback dynamics," mainly contrasts the potential for accelerating feedback with _no_ feedback, not self-undermining feedback.
Although we find support for accelerating feedback here, we agree with @Busemeyer2021 that a better understanding of the conditions that structure the existence and nature of public responsiveness will depend on more work pulling together both research traditions and considering the full range of potential outcomes.]

Still, one can imagine a reversal on this point.
It could well be that the public's response to increased officeholding women, to higher national legislative quotas for women, and to measures that improve women's roles in the workforce may eventually be self-undermining---but only once these work to the absolute, rather than merely relative, disadvantage of men.
For example, it would not be surprising for even a very egalitarian public to view a quota that required *more* than 50% of legislative candidates to be women as 'too much' [see @Paxton2021, xvi].
Of course, were such a policy adopted, we would again be speaking of policies of gender \emph{in}equality.
In any event, as yet few countries have even parity quotas, and---for worse or better---there is no sign of policies designed to allow men less than an equal share of descriptive representation in any countries.
As a practical matter, then, the findings reported here suggest that there is no reason to think that public opinion will ever consistently lash back against gender equality.

Note that the word _consistently_ is doing some work in that last sentence.
In our investigation we have only looked at average effects.
Whether the democratic representation and public responsiveness we find in this book vary with such features as institutional arrangements [see, e.g., @Powell2000; @Soroka2010] or socioeconomic structure [see, e.g., @Solt2008, 49; @Erikson2015, 26] remain questions for future investigation.
Still, establishing these baselines---that with regard to public opinion on gender equality, on average across the advanced democracies and over four to five decades, democratic representation does occur even in the short term and the public response is not backlash but demand for even more of what has been just produced---is a crucial step toward that future work.


## Implications for the Study of the Politics of Gender

The processes of democratic representation of macroegalitarian public opinion documented here constitutes a confirmation of theories long put forward by scholars of gender politics.
Whether labelled culture, ideology, or attitudes, these scholars have pointed to the importance of collective views on gender roles to politics and policy for many decades.

Nevertheless, the lack of appropriate data has led to the exclusion of macroegalitarianism from much empirical work.
This can be problematic.
For example, the finding of @Kim2022 that greater women's descriptive representation yields the adoption of more policies advancing gender equality in employment appears, in light of our findings, to be spurious.
Changes in women's share of the national legislature are predicted by changes in gender egalitarian public opinion (see @fig-m1-dr).
Trends in macroegalitarianism also predict policy adoption, even when women's share of officeholding is controlled, while women's officeholding does not (see @fig-m1-wbl).
These results suggest a very different mechanism through which policies advancing gender equality are adopted.
These policy gains are not achieved by women legislators working alone, but rather by both women and men legislators seeking to bring policy into better alignment with the egalitarian views of the public: adaptation, not selection, dominates in this case.
More generally, they suggest that the close relationships among these variables means that well-grounded conclusions can only be reached when all of them are included in our analyses.

It is worth noting that we focused our inquiry on politics and policy in relatively rich democracies of the OECD.
This choice was based in long-standing theory that the pressure on parties and legislators to represent public opinion is most pervasive where access to power depends on success in contested elections.
That is, the countries of the OECD collectively constitute a 'most likely case.' Whether our findings hold in other contexts remains an open question.
Whether women's descriptive representation and policies advancing equality depend dynamically on macroegalitarianism across democracies among developing countries or in autocracies are promising lines of future inquiry.

## Implications for Policy

There is no need to worry about backlash: our results indicate that policies that advance gender equality work instead to help create their own constituencies.
@Bishin2016: it is not public opinion you need to fear, it is the power of mobilized opponents with money

Research that incorporates the roles of both social movements and public opinion is relatively rare.
@Burstein1998 concluded that social movements only succeed in gaining policy change through influencing public opinion.
Our findings are that increases in both feminist movement strength and macroegalitarianism yield policies advancing gender equality.

## Implications for Democracy

Gender equality is democracy.

Evidence that public opinion, considered as support for democracy in the abstract, leads to democratic deepening or prevents democratic backsliding has been scant [compare @Claassen2020a; @Tai2024].

Our findings indicate that macroegalitarianism is at least part of the story of how public opinion reinforces democracy.

<!-- Combining recognition that gender equality is democracy (e.g., Krook2022 in APSA-CP; @Piscopo2024 (which also cites Archenti and Tula 2017; Palma 2021)) with debates on how public opinion affects democracy (Claassen and DCPO) yields the understanding that public gender egalitarianism is democratic support (see, maybe, Welzel2013) -->
