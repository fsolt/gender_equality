We want to know how public opinion responds to movement toward gender equality, but we think it makes the most sense to start the inquiry with the representation of opinion in politics and policy. 

## Representation: From Opinion to Politics and Policy

Typology of representation: descriptive, substantive, symbolic [@Pitkin1967]

In public opinion research, policy representation occurs when policy change reflects changes in public opinion.

We consider _dynamic_ descriptive representation as whether changes in the share of women in the national legislature reflects gender egalitarian public opinion.
We use dynamic _substantive_ representation to refer to the question of whether changes in macroegalitarianism are reflected in changes in policies advancing gender equality.

Reasons for opinion, in general, to matter to politics and policy [@Miller2015; @Bowler2017; @Dassonneville2021a]

With regard to gender egalitarianism, the case for representation is straightforward: at least in democratic countries, when the electorate holds a more gender-egalitarian view of women's roles in the public sphere, parties will run more women, more women will win election, and policies advancing gender equality will be more likely to pass.
Where traditional attitudes relegating women to the private sphere of home and children are more dominant, conversely, parties put forward fewer female candidates, fewer women gain office, and anti-egalitarian public policy will not change.
Indeed, @Beer2009 [, 214] says this story is so straightforward that it is tautological---that gender egalitarian public opinion itself "seems to be a very good measure of gender equality."

There are, however, many reasons for gender egalitarian public opinion to _not_ translate to either more women in office or the adoption of policies that advance gender equality.

sexist or even just skeptical/anxious party gatekeepers

related: misperceptions of public opinion among legislators [@Walgrave2022]

competing issue priorities, both of voters and parties [see @Powell2004, 291; @Costello2021; @Alvarez2024; specifically with regard to gender attitudes, see @Hayes2016; @Araujo2022; and see also the emphasis on _autonomous_ women's movements in @Htun2012; @Forester2022] as well as straight-up failures in 'voting correctly' [see @Lau1997]

These competing issues may be brought forward through the greater relative power of the wealthy in an exercise of the second face of power [see, e.g., @Solt2008; @Erikson2015; @Schakel2021].

institutional veto players

The argument for representation may appear strong, but to see if and to what extent the composition of legislatures and the content of policy represent the macroegalitarianism of the public, we are going to have to look.


## Public Responsiveness: From Politics and Policy to Opinion

Thermostatic public opinion: opinion moves opposite to policy [@Wlezien1995; @Soroka2010; @Atkinson2021]

Policies make their own constituencies: opinion moves to further support policy

The public sometimes doesn't respond at all [@Atkinson2021]


### Policies Advancing Gender Equality

We focus on gender equality in the traditionally masculine public sphere of politics and paid employment.

@Beer2009 [, 217]: "there is some scholarly consensus that gender equality should be assessed in terms of three domains: capabilities, opportunities, and empowerment/agency"
@Bericat2012: "education, work and power"

The policies we consider, then, are among those @Htun2010 [, 210, 209] call _non-doctrinal_: they do not "touch upon the jurisdictional conflict between the state and other organizations over the administration of kinship relations, reproduction, and sexuality" and so do not "challenge religious doctrine or the codified tradition of a major cultural group."
This means, mercifully, that we don't have to also control for the strength of the church as an opponent to reform.


## The Scope of the Theory
Before we proceed further, we need to define the universe for the study.
As always, there are competing concerns.  
On the one hand, we want to look as broadly as possible: we want to minimize sampling bias that could influence our results and conclusions.
Too much work in political science 
The desire to get beyond "just the U.S." or "just western Europe" was of course a big reason to generate the PGE data in the first place, to enable "cross-national, cross-regional" work [see @Wilson2022].
But, on the other hand, we always need to avoid including cases to which the theory simply does not apply.
The theories outlined above presuppose a certain minimum level of democracy---at least the minimal Przeworkski, Alvarez, Cheibub, and Limongi definition of democracy, "contested elections with broad suffrage for the most important offices"--and so countries that don't clear that very low bar should be excluded.^[
This is not to say that governments in authoritarian countries do not at least sometimes work to represent public opinion.
In fact, there is reason to think---and evidence to show---that they sometimes do [see, e.g., @Tang2016 on China; @Lueders2022 on the German Democratic Republic].
Our point here is that the mechanisms through which public opinion may be translated to policy in authoritarian regimes is different from those suggested in the theories outlined above, and so for present purposes we should set those cases aside.]
And politics works in many developing democracies in ways that suggest that the processes these theories describe may unfold very differently there---widespread clientelism, for example, is thought to work to exclude women from politics at every level [see, e.g, @Arriola2014; @Franceschet2014; @Benstead2015; @Paxton2021, 156-157].
So in light of these considerations, we are looking at advanced democracies.
It's important, though, to be sure to not interpret "advanced democracies" as simply "western Europe and the British offshoots."
And, further, one doesn't want to open the door to the garden of forking paths that comes with hand-picking countries.
So we settled on the 38 countries of the current OECD (see @fig-oecdmap).
Yes, it's the usual suspects of most of Europe plus the United States and 
Canada-Australia-New Zealand, but also Japan and Korea in east Asia, Turkey and Israel in west Asia, and Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Chile in Latin America.
Or, you know, about one China's worth of people; it's easy to see that there's still a lot of other, unshaded countries to better understand also.
But the theories outlined in this chapter apply to these darker shaded countries, so they will be the subject of this book.

** Virtuous Circle among Women’s Descriptive Representation, Women Friendly Public Policies, and Public Gender Egalitarianism

In this book, we aim to theorize and empirically examine the virtuous circle among women’s descriptive representation, women friendly public policies or laws, and public gender egalitarianism. 
The existing literature examines the influence of each factor on each other separately [@Lawless2004; @Lombardo2017; @Stokke2009]. 
For instance, some scholars have focused on the role of women’s descriptive representation on the adoption of women friendly policies [@Berkman1993; @Bratton2002; @Caiazza2004; @Cowell-Meyers2009; @Crowley2004; @Li-Ju2008; @Thomas1991a; @Tolbert2001], while others emphasize the role of such policies or laws on improving women’s descriptive representation [@Celis2009; @Freidenberg2020; @Jabeen2020].

The rest of this chapter will be proceeded with the following orders. 
First, we will describe the association between women’s descriptive representation and women friendly public policies or laws along with thorough literature review on such relationship. 
Rather than only focusing on the one-directional influence of each factor on the other, we will introduce how the two are interconnected with each other. 

Then, we will summarize how women friendly public policies or laws is associated with public gender egalitarianism. 
For instance, how does the adoption of women friendly policies affect public gender egalitarianism and does public gender egalitarianism influence the adoption of such public policies back and forth. 
Lastly, we will examine the link between public gender egalitarianism and women’s descriptive representation. 
Does the increase in women’s descriptive representation improve public gender egalitarianism? 
And, is the improvement of public gender egalitarianism translated into the emergence of women’s descriptive representation? 
This book again does not merely put emphasis on the one-direction but also examine the two-way interaction.

** The Association between Women’s Descriptive Representation and Women Friendly Public Policies

The association between women’s descriptive representation and women friendly public policies or laws has been received wide academic attention from many scholars [@Atkinson2019; @Bratton2002; @Childs2018; @Cowell-Meyers2009; @Piscopo2011; @Swers2020; @Woo2021b]. 
Political representation can be broadly divided into descriptive representation, substantive representation and symbolic representation according to [@Pitkin1967b]. 

Women’s descriptive representation is related to the manner of how representatives stand for their represented groups, which is female in the case of women’s descriptive representation. 
On the contrary, substantive representation is defined as “acting in the interests of the represented in a manner responsive to them” (Pitkin, 1967: 209). 
Moreover, symbolic representation is about the representation of a group or state through an object such as a flag which stands for the represented groups [@Lawless2004; @Lombardo2017; @Stokke2009].

The ways of measuring the degree of women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation differ among scholars. 
For instance, some scholars measure the levels of women’s descriptive representation of a country based on the number of female political leaders [@Reingold2008], while others use the percentage of female policy-makers in legislative branches to measure women’s descriptive representation [@Childs2018; @Ferland2022; @Woo2022a]. 
For instance, @Childs2018 examines the involvement and impact of female legislators by focusing on the increased percentage of female legislators in national parliaments. 
Also, @Woo2022a by analyzing African countries demonstrated that the increase in women’s descriptive representation tends to promote policies and laws combating human trafficking.

The measure of women’s substantive representation is more complex compared to that of women’s descriptive representation. 
According to the crucial work from @Wängnerud2009, women’s substantive representation has been measured or can be measured with political attitudes of both female and male legislators, with policy priorities which are related to what kinds of issues will be prioritized by legislators, and with policy outcome or policy promotion concerning women friendly policies.

The influence of women’s descriptive representation on women’s substantive representation measured by political attitudes and policy priorities is much clear. 
The existing literature shows that female legislators tend to be more liberal or politically left leaning compared to their male counterparts [@Flammang1997; @Frankovic1982; @Thomas1991a; @Thomas2014]. 
By analyzing data from a mail survey of more than 2,500 legislators across states, @Poggione2004 finds that female legislators show more support on the adoption of welfare policy and law liberalism which index is composed of 17 dichotomous items about legislators’ support on the principles of welfare reform. 

In addition, even though @McCarty1997 argue that the pro-liberal attitude of female legislators can be totally explained by district factors, @Welch1985 and @Burrell1996, based on conservative coalition support scores from the 93rd and 96th U.S. Congresses, demonstrate that congresswomen tend to be more ideologically liberal rather than their male counterparts. 
Moreover, @Swers2002 creates a database about the number of bills related to women’s issues and unveils that female legislators pay more attention to women’s issues regardless of their partisanships by comparing male and female members of House of Representatives in the United States during 103rd and 104th Congresses. 
More recently, @McEvoy2016 by analyzing political attitudes between voters and representatives in the European parliament shows that female candidates and legislators tend to replicate political attitudes and policy preferences of female public.

The distinctive differences in political attitudes are also easily observed in the attitudes toward women’s related issues or women’s interests including social policy, affirmative actions, or pornography, and so on [@Burrell1996; @Dolan2021; @Gehlen1977; @Hessami2020; @Leader1977; @Ramstetter2019; @Wängnerud2009]. 
@Berkman1993 show that female representatives are more likely to secure committee assignments allowing them to block pro-life legislation such as abortion policy. 
In addition, with the voting records of all representatives in the 103rd Congress on women’s issues, @Swers1998 reveals that female legislators are likely to vote for women’s issues while controlling other major factors of congressional voting such as individual characteristics, ideology, and constituency factors. 
The work from @Ramstetter2019 investigates the European parliament demonstrates that female legislators are more likely to protect environmental issues by active legislation toward such issues.

We should note that some previous literature, especially the U.S. context, argues that there has been a growing divide between Democratic and Republican women and similarity among male and female legislators in the same political parties, and emphasize the crucial role of a political party [@Frederick2009; @Osborn2012]. 
Based on @Aldrich2011, @Thomsen2015 demonstrates that both self-selection and party recruitment make the influence of partisanship in determining the ideology of individual legislators. 
The intersectionality of female decision-makers in terms of political attitudes has continuously examined by scholars over decades [@Fernandes2021; @Lloren2020].

While attitudes are the matter of “on the issues” which are already politicized or publicized, priorities are related to what kinds of issues will be politicized or put on the agenda [@Wängnerud2009]. 
As the differences between female and male representatives on attitudes toward issues have been studied broadly, the different priorities of issues from female and male representatives are also widely studied by scholars [@Diaz2005; @Reingold2003; @Swers1998; @Wängnerud2000]. 
The differences in priorities between female and male representatives are largely based on the distinct psychological development of women and men [@Chorodow1978; @Jones1997]. 
As @Childs2006 said “There is some, albeit inconclusive, evidence that increases in the percentage of female deputies also lead to the advancement of policy issues that are important women, such as childcare, equal pay, and protection against women”, there has been a consensus that female representatives tend to prioritize women’s issues, even though empirical results can be different based on how researchers determine and measure women’s issues.

In American Politics, @Thomas1991b, based on the 1988 survey of members of the lower houses of the state legislatures in twelve states, show that female state legislators’ list of priority bills tend to include more legislations about children and family than the lists of men; that female representatives are likely to introduce more welfare bills than male counterparts; that women tend to be on health and welfare committees; and that women are likely to list women’s issues as accomplishments. 
They support the gender influence on the issue priorities by saying that “Increased numbers of women legislators mean a larger potential support network for women who push issues of importance to them”.

More recently, @Atkinson2019 analyze all bills introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1963 to 2009. 
They classify issues of bills into 19 topic areas and demonstrate that female representative tends to devote more attention on the issues including “civil rights, and liberties”, “education”, “health”, “law, crime, and family issues,” and “social welfare compared to their male counterparts. 
Moreover, some studies also show that female legislators tend to focus on social and family issues compared to male legislators [@Diamond1977; @Kirkpatrick1974; @Werner1968], and the influence of potential support network for women is the pre-requisite of the difference between male and female priorities [@Flammang1985; @Saint-Germain1989].

The differences in priorities between women and men also exist in other developed and developing countries. 
@Schwindt‐Bayer2006 reveals that female legislators tend to place a higher priority on women’s issues and children/family concerns by examining all bills initiated during two congresses in Costa Rica and Colombia, 1994-98 and 1998-2002, and two years in Argentina, 1995 and 1999. 
@Taylor-Robinson2003’s case study on Honduran Congress from 1990-93 also finds that female legislators are likely to emphasize women’s rights issues, even though they show that there is no difference between female and male legislator’s priorities on children’s and family issues. 
In addition, @Wängnerud2006 analyzes Swedish parliaments over 20 years and finds that 75% of women in parliaments focused on the issues of social policy, family policy, care for the elderly, and health care when they conduct election campaigns. 
Compared to women, only 44% of men in parliaments address those issues in 1985. 
More recently @Tam2017 finds that female legislators in an undemocratic or semi-democratic legislature focus on women’s interests rather than male legislators do by conducting a case study of Hong Kong. 
Moreover, related to African countries, @Gottlieb2018 show that female political leaders and public are more likely to pay attention on health related issues.

Likewise, the differences between female and male representatives are widely studied and empirically tested.	
Even though female legislators have distinctive features compared to their male counterparts as mentioned above [@Atkinson2019; @Gottlieb2018; @Tam2017], the influence of women’s descriptive representation on the adoption of women friendly policies has been questioned by many studies [@Niederle2007; @Wängnerud2009]. 
In other words, there have been conflicting arguments among scholars on such impacts [@Hessami2020]. 

The policy outcome or policy promotion that women legislators can make has been relatively less examined. 
@Wängnerud2009 emphasized this relative marginalization as “Although there are studies on policy promotion, the closer one gets to outcomes in citizens’ everyday lives, the fewer empirical findings there are to report.” 
Given the importance of politics on citizens’ everyday lives, the evaluation on the link between women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation including policy changes should be conducted to fully understand the influence of women’s descriptive representation and the differences that women representatives can make. 
As @Bratton2002 emphasize the importance of evaluating the connection between women’s descriptive representation and policy outcomes by mentioning that “The link between descriptive representation and substantive representation is most meaningful when descriptive representation affects not only a representative’s attitudes and behavior but also the decisions made by the overall legislative body”, studying the association between women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation is essential. 
In this section, we will introduce both studies.

It has long been argued that women’s descriptive representation is likely to influence the adoption of women friendly policies in addition to the changes in terms of political attitudes and policy priorities. 
Although the relative deficiency of studies about policy outcomes that women can make, there are also previous studies about this topic [@Berkman1993; @Bratton2002; @Caiazza2004; @Cowell-Meyers2009; @Crowley2004; @Li-Ju2008; @Thomas1991a; @Tolbert2001]. 
The previous studies on this issue are concentrated on American Politics. 
However, there are also some studies in developing and other developed countries. 

The politics of presence theory developed by @Phillips1995 asserts that the gender of representatives is an influential factor in representative democracy [@Mansbridge1999; @Phillips1998; @Tamerius2010; @Williams2000; @Young2002]. 
Based on the assumption that female legislators and female citizens have shared life experiences such as child-rearing or exposure to violence, Phillips (1995, pp. 67–68) underlines that the entrance of women into politics is a prerequisite for the politicization of women’s issues. 
Some studies interviewing legislators and legislative staffers provide empirical evidence for the politics of presence theory [@Burden2007; @Grose2011; @Lawless2015; @Swers2016; @Wangnerud2012].

In addition to the politics of presence theory, the critical mass theory has also been widely used as a theoretical framework to explain the association between women’s descriptive and substantive representation [@Celis2008a; @Cowell-Meyers2009; @Espírito-Santo2020; @Homola2021]. 
The critical mass theory posits that a certain proportion of female legislators in legislative bodies is needed for women to make their voices audible in the policy-making process [@Dahlerup1988; @Dahlerup2006a; @Kanter1977]. 
According to Kanter (1977, pp. 966–972), in skewed groups where a large preponderance of one dominant group exists, the dominant tends to control the minority (also termed “tokens”). 
Due to their minority status, the tokens with more visibility in a society tend to suffer from stereotypes, isolation from the society, and confirmation to dominant models, which, in turn, reinforce the skewed structure (Kanter, 1977, pp. 971–2). 
In this case, it is hard for female representatives to make their voice for women’s interests and rights heard.

On the other hand, when the number of “tokens” increases to a certain point, this prevents them from being isolated by the dominant group. 
The possible allies and coalitions among female representatives under this condition make it possible for them to break the vicious circle, to escape female stereotypes and role entrapment, and to pursue their interests (Kanter 1977, p. 966). 
Therefore, once the proportion of female representatives reaches a certain point, female legislators politicize women’s issues including violence against women more efficiently and can make their male counterparts take bills related to women’s issues more seriously [@Celis2007; @Dahlerup2014].

Theories developed by @Gilligan1982 and @Mansbridge1999 also support the positive influence of women’s descriptive representation on substantive representation.
@Gilligan1982 argues that men and women have been taught differently regarding views on morality. 
The main thrust of her theory is that women, unlike men, tend to be taught empathy and compassion as the core of morality from childhood. 
This difference in the “ethics of care” between men and women makes women pay more attention to issues such as welfare policies and the avoidance of using military forces [@Chorodow1978; @Ruddick1980]. 
In addition, Mansbridge (1999), using a case study of the U.S., theorizes that female representatives can appropriately reflect the needs of female citizens based on their shared experience. 
Mansbridge (1999) argues that because of their common female identity, female legislators are more likely than male legislators to understand the problems female citizens experience, formulate legal solutions to those problems, and incorporate the solutions into the legislative processes. 
She also demonstrates that female legislators tend to focus more on women’s issues including education, health, and welfare than male legislators do, because female representatives facilitate conversations with female citizens and politicize the problems affecting them.

Concerning the case of the United States, @Saint-Germain1989 conducts a longitudinal analysis about public policy output in the Arizona State Legislature between 1969 and 1986 and reveals that women legislators tend to initiate more bills about women’s interests and feminist issues than male counterparts, which in turn produces more public policies about women’s interests. 
More recently, @Cowell-Meyers2009 investigate the association between women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation by using logistic and least-squares estimations. 
Based on the examination of 34 policies including violence against women, child policies, welfare policies, etc. which are identified by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) as the interests of women in the U.S. States, they find evidence that a higher level of women’s descriptive presentation in state legislatures tends to lead state-level policies favoring women in the 1990s on 5 of the 34 policies such as favorable policies and child support. 
In addition, @Eckhouse2019 reveals that descriptive representation increases criminal justice by conducting a case study in the United States.

In addition to the direct influence of women’s descriptive representation on substantive representation, @Caiazza2004 shows the indirect effect of women’s descriptive representation on policy outcomes. 
She suggests a two-staged relationship from party and gender attitudes to women-friendly policies including employment protections of women, legislation protecting sexual minorities, and reproductive rights, through women’s representation. 
Using data about state policies in 2000, she revealed that the favorable attitudes toward women representatives and Democratic dominance tend to increase the proportion of female state legislators and in turn lead to a higher level of women-friendly policies. 

Studies about the link between women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation are not confined only to the U.S., but also conducted with a focus on other countries in various regions in the world. 
@Bratton2002 investigate the link between women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation measured by the provision of childcare with the focus on the Norwegian municipalities in 1975, 1979, 1983, 1987, and 1991. 
They show that the proportion of women in the council leads the provision of childcare by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regressions. 
In terms of the adoption of policies related to family leave, @Kittilson2008 demonstrates that the presence of women in parliaments significantly influences the adoption and scope of both maternity and childcare leave policies by analyzing family leave policies in 19 democratic countries from 1970 to 2000. 
More importantly, she argues that the women’s descriptive representation in legislative branches has played a more important role in adopting such policies rather than the ideology of the party in power. 
A more recent study from @Wiener2021 relying on an experimental approach provides evidence for the link between women’s descriptive and substantive representation.

Some evidence comes from studies on non-democratic countries. 
@Bauer2013 conduct a case study about two different sub-Saharan African countries: Botswana which is a democratic country and Rwanda which is an authoritarian single-party dominant country. 
They argue that women’s descriptive representatives are helpful to achieve substantive representation of women even in undemocratic countries. 
@Nistotskaya2018 also demonstrate that the positive dynamics between women’s political representation and women-friendly policy outcomes in a large electoral autocracy, Russia.

The existing cross-national studies also provide evidence for the influence of women’s descriptive representation on substantive representation. 
@Bolzendahl2007 analyze the influence of women’s political power on welfare state effort within 12 capitalist democracies. 
With Prais-Winsten regression with panel-corrected standard errors, they demonstrate that higher women’s descriptive representation tends to increase the levels of social expenditure while controlling a series of variables such as year, unemployment, GDP per capita, and constitutional structure. 
Moreover, @Schwindt-Bayer2005’s seminal work shows that time-series cross-national study on the examination of the link is promising. 
The main question they try to answer in their article is whether women’s descriptive representation increases legislatures’ responsibilities to women’s issues or not. 
As main dependent variables, they use a series of policies including weeks of maternity leave, women’s social and political equality, and marital equality in law. 
Using data about 31 democracies, they provide evidence for the positive influence of women’s descriptive representation on substantive representation.

However, findings on the association between women’s descriptive representation and substantive representation are mixed at best. 
There are some studies which demonstrate that the influence of women’s descriptive representation in parliaments on policy outcomes and policy promotions is insignificant, at best very marginal.

@Tolbert2001 build an index of women’s health mandates based on the nine specific policies such as breast cancer screening and direct access to ob-gyns without a referral from primary care physicians and test whether women’s descriptive representation in state legislatures leads the adoption of women’s health mandates or not. 
They show that the presence of women in the state legislature in the 1990s and of women in leadership positions does not influence policy adoptions about women’s health policies. 
Also, @Thomas1994 distinguishes between legislative procedures such as political speeches, co-work with colleagues, and the interaction with lobbyists, and legislative products including voting records, issue attitudes, and policy priorities. 
By empirically comparing the difference between female and male legislators, she demonstrates that the gender gap in legislative procedures is closing but that in legislative products is not.

Focusing on the role of feminist autonomous movements, @Htun2012’s crucial cross-national study on the association between female autonomous movement and progressive policy change focusing on violence against women also does not support the influence of women’s descriptive representation on policy outcomes. 
They build an index to measure the level of progressive policies in randomly selected 70 countries in 1975, 1985, 1995, and 2005. 
The index of progressive policy, ranging from 0 to 10, is based on whether a country has services to victims of violence against women, legal reform, policy or program targeting vulnerable populations of women, training professionals, prevention programs, and administrative reforms. 
Through OLS regression, they reveal that strong autonomous domestic feminist movement, women’s policy machinery, and global and regional norms tend to lead countries to redress violence against women. 
On the contrary, they argue that women’s descriptive representation in legislatures measured by the proportion of women is insignificant and has only negligible impacts.

In their subsequent study with the same dataset, @Weldon2013 reemphasize the important role of feminist activism rather than the number of women legislators. 
Previous to @Htun2012, @Weldon2002 shows that the interaction between the feminist autonomous movements and women’s policy machinery has a strong significant impact on the policy action against violence against women in 36 democratic countries. 
In addition, some studies on individual countries have also provided empirical supports for the null effects of the women’s presence in legislative branches on the comprehensiveness of violence against women legislations [@Beer2017].

Contrarily, the adoption of women friendly public policies can also positively influence women’s descriptive representation. 
Women friendly public policies or laws, especially gender quotas, can promote the degree of women’s descriptive representation. 
Gender quotas which is one of the women friendly public policies or laws has been regarded as a ‘fast track’ to increase women’s descriptive representation [@Clayton2018; @Dahlerup2022]. 
Even though the influence of gender quotas might differ by types of quotas such as legislative quotas, party quotas, and reserved seats quotas [@Chen2010; @Clayton2021], the adoption of gender quotas increases women’s descriptive representation. 

For instance, @O’brien2016 based on cross-national studies demonstrate that gender quotas tends to accelerate women’s presence in political leadership throughout acceleration affects of gender quotas. 
Moreover, @Barnes2020 by analyzing 1,700 legislators in Argentinian subnational government show that gender quotas improve women’s descriptive representation, while at the same time the quotas increases the professional and personal diversity of women and men in office. 
They also demonstrate that the adoption of gender quotas redefines candidate quality, recruitment patterns and perceptions. 
Also, in terms of political empowerment, @Park2023 by revisiting the links between gender quotas and women’s descriptive representation reveals that gender quotas is one of the most significant tools to impact women’s descriptive representation.

In addition to the adoption of gender quotas, other women friendly public policies or laws is likely to positively affect women’s descriptive representation. 
For example, the adoption of parental leave, childcare, equal pay, and protection against violence policies and laws provide environments and conditions for women to pursue their careers in both societal and political leadership positions. 
While the adoption of such policies makes such conditions for women which is often regarded as a prerequisite of the improvement of women’s descriptive representation, the introduction of women friendly policies can also improve women’s descriptive representation by overcoming more traditional cultural values about the gender role and gender egalitarianism [@Stockemer2015].

The crucial study from @Mansbridge1999 argues that less obtrusive enabling devices such as childcare and parental leave can reduce the barriers to women’s descriptive representation and might be more effective than the adoption of gender quotas. 
In the following study [@Mansbridge2003], she theorizes that the adoption of less obtrusive enabling devices allowing equal opportunity for both female and male can lead to the natural improvement of women’s descriptive representation. 
The expectation from @Mansbridge2003 has been qualitatively and quantitatively supported by a series of studies [@Celis2009; @Freidenberg2020; @Jabeen2020]. 
Likewise, the relationship between women’s descriptive representation and women friendly policy adoption is not one-directional but bi-directional.

** The Association between Women Friendly Public Policies on Public Gender Egalitarianism

As the link between women’s descriptive representation and the adoption of women friendly policy is not unidirectional, the adoption of women friendly public policies or laws and public gender egalitarianism is also interconnected. 
The adoption of women friendly public policies and laws can boost public gender egalitarianism, while the improved public gender egalitarianism makes both male and female decision-makers pay more attention on the adoption of women friendly policies and laws.

How women friendly public policies affect public gender egalitarianism? The female empowerment with the adoption of women friendly public policies can be perceived as the cultural and social changes from conservative and traditional values to conditions promoting gender egalitarian attitudes [@Morgan2013]. 
The adoption of women friendly policies followed by the improvement of female power and the increase in female status is regarded as the way to further develop the public approval of gender equality and egalitarianism [@Alexander2012; @Banaszak1993; @Phillips1995].

The mechanism behind the influence of the adoption of women friendly policies on public gender egalitarianism slightly differs by types of policies. 
The adoption of supportive work-family policies such as parental leave policies can also promote gender equality and egalitarian attitudes in both the workplace and in the household [@Maume2016; @Thébaud2016]. 
To be specific, paid leave and parental leave policies which are representative women friendly policies have been studied as policies improve public gender egalitarianism [@Hegewisch2013]. 
The moderate length of paid leaves tends to link to the flexible work arrangements along with public childcare, which enforces labor participation rates for women [@Noonan2013].

Another example of the relationship between the adoption of women friendly policies and public gender egalitarianism can be found at the adoption of gender quotas. As mentioned earlier, the adoption of gender quotas in many different forms is one of the most efficient ways to improve women’s descriptive representation [@Franceschet2012; @Krook2010a; @Tripp2008]. 
At the same time, the adoption of gender quotas can also affect public gender egalitarianism in a positive direction [@Beaman2009b; @Clayton2014]. 
For instance, @Beaman2009b by examining the case of Indian villages demonstrate that gender quotas is closely related to the public acceptance toward female political leaders. 
Even though some scholars have pessimistic about the influence of gender quotas on improve public gender egalitarianism [@Batista Pereira2020], the study from @Kim2023a unveils that the mechanism of visibility rooted from the adoption of gender quotas increases public approval of women in politics.

Political behaviors of other political leaders other than the adoption of public policies also can affect public gender egalitarianism [@Kittilson2010; @Morgan2013; @Zaller1992]. Conducting population-based survey experiment of over 2700 subjects, the study from [@Bulut2023] by examining the case of President Erdogan’s patriarchal statements demonstrates that the statements significantly affect public gender egalitarian attitudes in a negative way. 
Not only the women’s public gender attitudes change, but also men’s do [@Beaman2009a].

Then, conversely how does the increase in the public gender egalitarianism facilitate the adoption of women friendly policies and laws. 
It has long been assumed that decision-makers including legislators behave in order to maximize their probability of being re-elected [@Mayhew2004; @Mayhew1974]. 
Legislators tend to propose and support bills or policies matching with the public opinion and invest their limited resources such as money and time to meet the needs of their constituents [@De Mesquita2005]. 
Therefore, it is quite natural to expect that the improvement of public gender egalitarianism leads to the adoption of women friendly policies and laws. 
Not only in democratic countries, but also in non-democratic countries, legislative branches are likely to provide public policies and laws to maintain the public regime support and political stability [@Dickson2016; @Lazarev2007; @Rose2002].

Scholars have provided empirical evidence for the influence of public opinion on policy adoptions. Even though the following studies are not directly relevant to women friendly policies and laws, there have been academic attention on such relationship. 
Concerning countries’ foreign policies, political leaders or incumbents are likely not to ignoring the public opinion and to maintaining policy responsiveness [@Entman2004; @Robinson2008; @Tomz2020]. 
The study from @Baum2008 emphasizes the role of media to mediate the impacts of the public opinion on foreign policy. 

The influence of the public opinion on policy outcomes is not only tested with other policy areas. 
For instance, @Lax2009 examine the role of the public opinion on determining the adoption of policies concerning gays and lesbians. 
By using national surveys, they create new estimates of public support for policies such as nondiscrimination laws. 
Then, they find that there is a high degree of policy responsiveness. It is also not difficult to find empirical evidence support the link between the public opinion and policy adoptions [@Shapiro2011; @Stimson1995]. 
The association between public opinion and the adoption of policies or laws has been also found related to the issue of minority rights [@Kreitzer2014], morality policy [@Patton2007], electric vehicles [@Brückmann2020], and justice policy [@Ringquist2002].

Directly related to the adoption of women friendly policies and laws, the existing literature has provided support evidence for the crucial role of public gender egalitarianism or egalitarian attitudes over decades. 
Even though some scholars maintain that the changes in public opinion after the adoption of women friendly policies are under-researched [@Bustelo2017; @Mazur2017], there have been some efforts [@True2001; @Verge2021].

One of the most salient examples of the influence of public gender egalitarianism on the adoption of women friendly policies is the adoption of parental leave policies. 
The adoption of parental leave policies has been framed related to women’s economic equality and family roles [@Arendell2000; @Hobson2002; @Smith2020]. 
Much earlier, @Garand1995 emphasize the role of public support for women’s issues is one of the important driving factors of the adoption of state family leave policies in the American states during the late 1980s. 
They mentioned that constituency disposition variables including mass partisanship, mass ideology and general support for women’s issues are important of the adoption of parental leave policies.

The policy adoption concerning abortion rights provides another example of how the public opinion affect the adoption of women friendly policies. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that progressive gender attitudes tend to be related to the support for abortion rights [@Conover1988; @Fine2006; @Jelen2015]. 
The influence of public opinion on the adoption of abortion rights policies has been empirically supported. 
By focusing on the case of the United States, @Norrander1999 show that states dominated by a tradition of conservative policy tend to adopt more pro-life policies and vice versa. 
Recent studies have emphasized the conditions when the influence of public opinion on the adoption of women friendly policies is amplified. 
For instance, @Arceneaux2002 focuses on the role of direct democracy including initiatives and referenda makes states more responsive to public opinion on abortion policy.

The public opinion also can be amplified by the globalization and diffusion of feminist policies through transnational networks. 
For instance, @True2001 argue that the transnational networks and corresponding changes of public opinion on gender egalitarianism facilitates gender mainstreaming policy innovations. 
Moreover, the feminist activists and movements can also catalyze the influence of public gender egalitarianism on the adoption women friendly policies. 
Some argue that feminist activists through both formal and informal engagement with institutions and deliver public gender egalitarianism [@Chappell2000; @Htun2012], while others emphasize the role of feminist strategic alliances to translate public gender egalitarianism into policies [@Guenther2008; @Verge2021].

The negative influence of public opinion on the adoption of policies and laws has also been observed. 
In other words, public opinion which is opposite to gender egalitarianism hiders governments from adopting women friendly policies and laws. 
For instance, Roman Catholic countries including Brazil, Poland, and Chile experienced legislative rollbacks concerning women friendly policies due to the amplification of public opinion against gender equality by conservative groups [@Baldez2001; @Blofield2015; @Grzymała-Busse2015; @Schwindt-Bayer2018]. 
By analyzing the case of Myanmar, the recent study from @Htun2020 demonstrates that public opinion led by Burmese nationalist groups and politicians plays as an obstacle to seek greater gender equality.

As mentioned above, women friendly policies and public gender egalitarianism do not exist independently but interconnectedly. 
The adoption of women friendly policies is likely to improve public gender egalitarianism, even though there is a probability of backlash [@Kim2022; @Woo2023a; @Zaremberg2021a]. 
At the same time, the public opinion supporting public gender egalitarianism promotes the adoption of women friendly policies and laws, while the opinion opposing gender equality hinders legislators or other decision-makers from putting their efforts on the adoption such policies and laws.

** The Association between Public Gender Egalitarianism and Women’s Descriptive Representation

The influence of public gender egalitarianism on women’s descriptive representation and vice versa has also been examined by a myriad of studies.
In this section, we will introduce previous studies on the relationship between public gender egalitarianism and women’s descriptive representation and provide theories and mechanism behind such association.

The influence of public gender egalitarianism on women’s descriptive representation has relatively under-studied by scholars over decades. 
Even though some countries have tried to unveil the role of public attitudes toward gender balance in political leadership positions including legislators, the previous studies have more focused a case of a single country [@Allen2016; @Dolan2017; @Dolan2009; @Espírito-Santo2016; @Sanbonmatsu2003]. 
For sure, some studies have examined more than two countries. 
For instance, @Galligan2011 by analyzing the case of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland demonstrate the relationship between gender, generation and party support and a greater inclusion of women in politics. 

The public support for gender egalitarianism can be determined from the level of education, household composition, age, non-traditional family arrangements, etc [@Banaszak1993; @Dolan2017; @Dolan2009]. 
The economic development has also received wide attention from scholars in terms of the modernization theory [@Inglehart2003]. 
The public attitudes toward gender egalitarianism determined by a series of factors contribute to the more balanced gender distribution in politics. 
The crucial work from @Fernández2021 overcomes the previous studies which focus on one or two cases of countries. 
Using 2016 Eurobarometer, they examine the cross-national differences in public support for female political leaders and show the importance of public gender egalitarianism on explaining the variations in women’s descriptive representation.

The link between public gender egalitarianism and women’s descriptive representation can be seen natural. 
The public attitudes or individual attitudes are “independent drivers of a wide array of (…) behavioural sequelae of great personal and societal consequence” [@Hatemi2016]. 
The public attitude is one of the most important factor predicting the public’s political behavior especially related to their support for female candidates in terms of voting [@Lizotte2016]. 
It is also plausible that some women who support gender equality or believe the needs of women’s presence in policies can decide to run as candidates [@Fernández2021].

On the contrary, the increased women’s descriptive representation can improve the public support for gender egalitarianism. 
The impacts of women’s descriptive representation on public gender egalitarianism can be explained in the following mechanisms. 
First, the existence of female political leaders which is an out-group can increases the empathy toward such group [@Boisjoly2006]. 
To be specific, the increased women’s descriptive representation and the exposure to the representation might affect the public belief concerning the ability of women [@Alexander2012]. 
By analyzing 48 countries worldwide, @Allen2018 demonstrate that the presence of female political leaders positive affects public attitudes toward female political leaders. 

Second, the impacts of women’s descriptive representation on public gender egalitarianism can be explained with the function of role-model effects [@Biroli2018]. 
It has been known that female political leaders including both executive and legislative branches can inspire women and girls to be both socially and politically active [@Carroll1994; @Kittilson2005]. 
Moreover, it is also empirically supported that public experiencing higher women’s descriptive representation tends to exhibit greater gender equality [@Wolbrecht2007]. 
Concerning women’s political engagement and political participation, @Reingold2010 unveil the presence of women occupying or contesting public office is likely to enhance women’s political engagement by affecting public attitude on gender roles.

Third, much psychologically it has been regarded that the improvements in women’s descriptive representation tend to provide cues psychological hinderance of the public concerning traditional gender roles start to change [@Atkeson2003; @Hansen1997]. 
Even though such influence can be observed both from male and female, the role of women’s descriptive representation in eliminating the psychological hindrance is conditioned by the gender of individuals. 
For instance, many previous studies has emphasized that women and girls are more likely to be affected by the improved women’s descriptive representation or the presence of female political leaders [@Burns2001; @Reingold2010; @Sapiro1997].

Definitely, there is a probability that the improved women’s descriptive representation is always translated into the improved public gender egalitarianism. 
It is possible that the performance of female political leaders might negatively the public opinion toward gender egalitarianism. 
Gender stereotypes can make the public to consider that men compared to women are more suited for political leadership [@Garcia-Retamero2006; @Leeper1991]. 
The gender stereotype is dynamic not static. 
Some existing studies have argued that the examples of female political leaders can easily change the public attitude toward gender roles and egalitarian attitudes due to their rarity [@Dasgupta2004; @Diekman2005; @Sanbonmatsu2002]. 
Therefore, female political leaders’ failure can immensely affect public opinion in a negative way.
	
** Conclusion of this chapter

Throughout this chapter, we introduce the existing literature examining the relationship among women’s descriptive representation, women friendly public policies, and public gender egalitarianism. 
At the same time, we provide reasons behind how those three components are interconnected. 
As presented, a myriad of previous studies has provided ample empirical evidence of the interplay among those factors. 
However, even though the previous studies have broadened our understanding on how the three factors interplay with each other, comprehensive research considering the interaction among those factors has not been conducted systematically.

One of the main reasons behind the scarcity of the research can be summarized as the absence of comparable index for gender egalitarian attitudes. 
The absence of time-series cross-national index for public gender egalitarianism prevents us from examining the virtuous circle among women’s descriptive representation, women friendly public policies, and public gender egalitarianism. 
The lack of such index makes it hard for us to unveil the mechanism behind those factors. 
We tend to overcome the limitation of such index by developing the public gender egalitarianism (PGE) index based on our previous article [@Woo2023b].

It should be noted that the virtuous circle can be contaminated by the backlash from male [@Cupać2020; @Van Wormer2008; @Yeung2014; @Zaremberg2021a]. 
The anti-feminist backlash has been regarded as one of the main hinderance of the virtuous circle described in this chapter [@Berry2021; @Kim2022; @Woo2023a]. 
Scholars of status discontent theory argue that female empowerment is received as a threat by men in both social and political areas [@Franceschet2012]. 
The problem of anti-feminist backlash is not merely observed in developed countries but also in developing countries. 
Given that the anti-feminist backlash is not regional but global, @Fukuyama2018 emphasizes the crucial role of identity politics and conflicts such as gender conflicts including anti-feminist backlash in causing democratic backsliding and breakdown. 

For instance, @Krook2015 criticizes critical mass scholars by pointing out the possibility of backlash after the adoption of gender quotas. 
In other words, the adoption of gender quotas unintentionally negatively affects the public gender egalitarianism by causing anti-feminist backlash. 
Earlier, other scholars also pay attention to the problems of anti-feminist backlash especially related to violence against women over the globe [@Laidler2008; @Van Wormer2008]. 
More recent works demonstrate the existence and importance of anti-feminist backlash in the United States [@Faludi1991], United Nations [@Cupać2020], Latin American countries [@Zaremberg2021b] and other countries including South Korea [@Woo2023a].

In our following sections including the chapter of South Korea and Mexico, we will examine the interplay among women’s descriptive representation, women friendly policy adoption, and public gender egalitarianism. 
Given that the detrimental impacts of anti-feminist backlash on destructing the virtuous circle, we also pay attention on whether a country suffers from anti-feminist backlash or not both empirically and qualitatively.
