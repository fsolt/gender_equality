# How Public Opinion Shapes Gender Egalitarian Public Policy

The research question is one right at the heart of the politics of inequality: When do women win office? And what part do public attitudes toward gender roles play in the process?
Not surprisingly, given the importance of the question, we have a range of theories on this.

The first contends that this is a top-down process.
In this account, activists of the women's movement do the truly heroic work of convincing the patriarchal, male old guard of political parties to put women on the ballot.

On the one hand, this involves demanding--and getting--commitments that the party will have women make up a specific share of its slate of candidates, that is, that the party will adopt a gender quota.

On the other hand, whether or not a party makes a formal commitment in the form of a quota, activists push for parties to run more female candidates--and the push to overcome the biases of the existing male party leadership has proven easier when and where the electoral system consists of, or includes, a party-list component rather than only highly personalized races within small districts.
In the purest forms of the top-down theory, that's it: The activists' hard work within political parties to get more women on the ballot is the whole story.
In this telling, the public, the voters, are basically ambivalent with regard to electing men or women--and there *are* various experimental studies that provide evidence that this is true in some contexts--so it is the *supply* of female candidates that determines how many women win elected office.
Now, there's a *ton* of evidence--qualitative and quantitative--for the hypotheses implied by the top-down account, decades' worth of work on this topic, really, that show that quotas and party lists yield more women's descriptive representation.
It is, by now, super-well established stuff.

Yet there is a second theory, one that I'm going to label "bottom up," that contends that public attitudes cannot be dismissed as readily as they are in the purest top-down accounts.
The bottom-up story is straightforward: when the electorate holds a more gender-egalitarian view of women's roles in the public sphere, parties run more women, and more women win election.
Where traditional attitudes relegating women to the private sphere of home and children are more dominant, conversely, parties put forward fewer female candidates, and fewer women gain office.
Now, btw, I should mention that people in *this* literature, which stretches back to at least Wilma Rule Krause’s 1974 APSR article, people in this literature sometimes talk about these attitudes as ideology or culture; I'm with those who prefer to call broadly held attitudes and preferences "public opinion," but it’s all the same concept.

In addition, there’s a third possibility that I personally think makes a lot of sense.
This interactive theory says that public attitudes will shape the extent to which the institutions featured in the top-down theory yield more women in office.
There's been a lot of really detailed work across a wide range of cases that shows that a party's mere adoption of a quota isn't sufficient to get women in office.
A patriarchical party leadership can have it both ways: it can mollify, at least in the short run, the feminist activists it confronts by making a commitment to run more women, but then put female candidates only in unwinnable districts or in uncompetitive slots on the party's list.
And to the extent that the electorate holds traditional views, the old male party leadership can point to these public attitudes as justification for its half-hearted efforts.
As the public becomes more egalitarian, however, this patriarchical argument is undercut, and so not only will activists succeed in getting more women on the ballot, but these female candidates will be placed in more winnable positions. [see Ruedin 2012]
Put another way, as public demand for more women candidates grows, the supply provided by parties will respond.
Now, that's the argument for positive interactions.

There is another theory that suggests negative interactions.
Remember, interactions are always reciprocal, so if public opinion affects the effect of quotas, for example, that also implies that quotas affect the effect of public opinion.
And this effect may not be the positive, reinforcing, one that I outlined a moment ago.
If activists' success in winning the agreement of party leaders to adopt a quota or to place more women on the party list, if that success comes down to intraparty negotiations that are unrelated to public opinion as the top-down theory would lead us to expect, then these moves may increase supply well beyond the public's demand.
In that case, and I thank Aina for helpfully pointing this out to me, the interaction of gender quotas and lists with public opinion will be *negative*: that an effect of public opinion on women's descriptive representation may exist when there is not a quota or list, but this effect will be dampened, or even completely blotted out, when a quota is adopted or where there is a list.
