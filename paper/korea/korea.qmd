# Women as Chief Executives and Macroegalitarianism: The Case of South Korea

The perception that moves toward gender equality prompt backlashes in public opinion is widespread, as we noted at the beginning of this book.
It would come as no surprise to us if there are, among those reading these pages, some who will find at least some of the conclusions of our two previous chapters on dynamic democracy too good to believe, in particular those regarding public responsiveness.
Recall that, across the countries of the OECD over several decades, we found evidence for not only democratic representation, politics and policy reflecting public opinion, but also _positive_ public responsiveness to politics and policy, that is, that public opinion responds to women's electoral success and the adoption of more gender egalitarian policies by growing _more_ egalitarian.
Such accelerating feedback is exactly the opposite of what many observers fear is true.

Korea's recent political history seems to provide a strong basis for the apprehension that public opinion lashes back against women's successes in winning office and against other moves toward gender equality.
If public opinion backlash does not occur, how are we to understand events like Korea electing to its presidency Park Geun-hye, the country's first woman to hold that office, and then, just two elections later, choosing Yoon Suk-yeol, a man who built his political ascent around his anti-egalitarian views?
At least on its face, this sequence of events appears to contradict our conclusions.

In this chapter, we closely examine Park's presidency and the Korean public's reaction to it.
As we noted in the introduction to this book, the prominent literature on attitudes toward gender equality is heavily weighted toward case-study and small-_n_ research designs to the detriment of generalizability and causal inference.
We made much of the advantages offered by our broadly comparative and dynamic perspective.
Indeed, the prior chapters capitalized on these advantages to disentangle and reveal the processes of democratic representation and public responsiveness with regard to gender equality in the public sphere across the OECD over several decades.

But as is usual in cross-national research, our findings of robust democratic representation by parties and legislators of gender egalitarian public opinion and generally positive, self-reinforcing public responsiveness to advances toward gender equality represent averages across the observed countries and years.
In consequence, one response to perceptions of backlash in Korea and elsewhere would be simply to accept the possibility that such self-undermining feedback may sometimes occur, but it is not typical.
In other words, if the Korean public did lash back against progress toward gender equality as a result of Park's success in winning the presidency, that response was an anomaly, nothing more.
The extent of women's success in winning office merely increases the probability that the public becomes more egalitarian, after all; it does not determine that result [cf. @Dion1998].
Occasional exceptions to the rule are just to be expected.

However, leaving it at that---simply treating Korea as an exception and relegating it to the error term, as it were---is not only unlikely to soothe the concerned, it also misses an opportunity: close study of cases that are poorly explained by existing models offers suggestions for theoretical development [see, e.g., @Stephens1979, 100; @Ragin1987, 76-80; @Seawright2008, 302-303].
In particular, a case in which the purported cause is present but the expected outcome is absent can illuminate antecedent conditions the original theory  requires to operate [@VanEvera1997, 86].
If a woman achieves spectacular success in winning political office in Korea, but the country's public does not respond with growing support for gender equality in the public sphere as we found elsewhere but instead with backlash, it could be because some condition needed for accelerating feedback to occur is missing---or a condition that prevents accelerating feedback from occurring is present.

One circumstance that clearly distinguishes Park from the elected women whose successes we previously examined is that she was elected to Korea's presidency while those we studied in Chapter 4 were legislators.
The greater visibility of chief executives and the differing citizen expectations of legislators and executives [see @SweetCushman2022] could yield a different response of gender egalitarian public opinion to women's executive officeholding than the one we found for women's legislative officeholding.
We investigate this possibility in the next section.

Park Geun-hye was just nine years old when her father, Major General Park Chung-hee, led the overthrow of South Korea's elected government in 1961.
After first heading a military junta, Park Chung-hee narrowly won flawed elections to become president in 1963 and then ruled the country until he was assassinated in 1979 [see, e.g., @Lee1980].
He is credited as the architect of 'Miracle on the Han River,' an era of rapid economic growth and modernization: real economic growth averaged over 10% per year during his rule [see, e.g., @Haggard1990; @Kim2004]. 
This family background served as Park Geun-hye's foundational political identity.
To her supporters in Korea's conservative political party, she was regarded as a symbol of spectacular economic progress; to her liberal opponents, she was a reminder of dictatorial oppression [@Lee2017].

Park Geun-hye had taken on the role of acting First Lady in 1974 when her mother was killed in an attempt on Park Chung-hee's life; in this office, she made public appearances with her father and became involved in government initiatives [@Lee2017, 282].
After her father's death and the process of the democratization of South Korea, Park retreated from the public eye for nearly two decades, maintaining an image of reclusive principle.
Her career in electoral politics began in 1998.
She entered the National Assembly as a representative for the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) in a by-election for the Dalseong district of Daegu, where she was born; Daegu is part of the conservative heartland [@Jung2021, 75-77].
She was quickly recognized as a powerfully symbolic political leader and---like many women in politics [see, e.g., @Reyes-Housholder2020, 542]---established a political persona centered on personal integrity and the virtue of keeping promises [see @Shin2020].
She served as the party's chair from 2004 to 2006, navigating multiple crises and engineering improbable electoral victories; these feats earned her the moniker 'Queen of Elections' among her supporters [see, e.g., @Mun2015; @Lee2017].

This reputation for success, combined with her father's enduring support among older, more conservative voters, propelled her to the forefront of national politics.^[
Familial ties have been important to the election of many women chief executives, particularly in Asia and Latin America [see, e.g., @Jalalzai2008].
Among OECD countries, however, Park is unique as a dynastic heir.
The only other leader of an OECD country identified as having familial ties to politics by @Jalalzai2008 is Chile's Michelle Bachelet, whose father was an Air Force Brigadier General and, in 1972-1973, a member of President Salvador Allende's cabinet.]
After spearheading the GNP's rebranding as the Saenuri (New Frontier) Party, she secured the conservative nomination for the 2012 presidential elections.
Park campaigned as a leader "married to the nation" with the goals of restoring the high growth rates of her father's era and---in a break from her party's orthodoxy---delivering on Korea's constitutional mandate for economic democracy.
She went on to win the presidential election, becoming the first candidate since 1987 to garner an outright majority of the popular vote (51.56%).

Did Park's success in winning the Blue House as Korea's first woman president prompt a backlash in macroegalitarianism, public opinion toward gender equality in the public sphere?
@fig-koreapge plots the evolution of Korea's PGE scores before, during, and after Park's time in office.
The years during which Park held office are shaded in pale gray.
The PGE scores provide no clear evidence of a decline in gender egalitarian attitudes in Korea during these years.
When Park started her term in 2013, the country had a PGE score of 50.1 (80% credible interval: 46.2 to 52.2); at the end of her presidency, Korea's PGE score was estimated to have _risen_ to 51.3 (80% c.i.: 48.1 to 54.5).

But neither do these data show clear evidence of the _increase_ in macroegalitarianism that the cross-national results on women's legislative officeholding we presented in Chapter 4 would lead us to expect to occur during a time when the highest political office in the country was held by a woman. 
While estimated to be positive, the difference in PGE scores over these years---1.2 points---is not credibly different from zero (80% c.i.: -1.0 to 4.0).

We can dig even deeper, though.
One advantage of our focus on Korea in this chapter is that it facilitates looking at individual survey items in ways that are not possible when taking the broad comparative perspective that we employ elsewhere in this book.
@fig-kd1allplot1 displays the trends of mean responses to the survey questions on gender egalitarianism that were used to create the PGE scores for Korea, with the items regarding equality in politics in the left column and those on equality in the workplace on the right.
The years that Park held the presidency, 2013--2016, are again shaded in pale gray.
Among the questions on equality in politics, all but one suggest a decline during Park's term; among the questions on equality in the workplace, all but one do _not_ evince a decline during those years---if anything, they typically show a drop before Park took office followed by a recovery during her term.

Before exploring further, it is worth pausing a moment to recall that this pattern is distinctly atypical.
Remember, we found in Chapter 3 that public opinion about equality in politics and in the workplace are usually tightly bound to each other (see, for example, @fig-pge_pwe_corr_plot).
That they are not in this case suggests that something unusual---and potentially interesting---is going on.

We also pause to note that the two exceptions appear upon closer examination to be perhaps not that exceptional.
With regard to political equality, the only item that intersects with Park's years in office that shows an increase is "in general, men and women make equally good political leaders."
The upswing in agreement with this item, however, is evidenced only in 2023, some seven years after Park was replaced in office and at least four years later than the last observations of the other political-equality items.^[
Indeed, the survey on which this observation is based, Pew Research Center's 2023 East Asian Societies Survey, was so much later that its release was too recent for it to be included in the PGE scores employed in this book.]
And with regard to equality in the workplace, the only item for which egalitarian responses declined over Park's term was "men make better business leaders than women," which is also the only workplace item that implicates women's leadership.
It would seem on the basis of this evidence that Park's presidency negatively affected the Korean public's views specifically of women _in politics and positions of power_, if only for a few years.

One additional point often raised by observers of Korean politics with regard to Park's presidency is that it ushered in a period of intense political polarization, a time in which the views of men and women, young and old, and those with more and less education moved in opposite directions [see, e.g., @Cheong2023, 1219].
If this is true, by looking at _average_ responses as we have, we may be overlooking additional signs of backlash against gender equality that are limited to particular Korean demographic groups and, within the entire public's opinion, counterbalanced by the views of other groups.
Appendix D breaks down the responses to the available survey items on gender equality in Korea by gender, generation, and education.
It shows that responses generally move very similarly across these groups.
There are few signs of an increased polarization that worked to obscure a backlash against gender egalitarianism in Korea.


### Women Chief Executives and Public Opinion

In the previous section, we found that the Korean public's general attitudes toward gender equality in the public sphere did not decline over Park's presidency, but that its views toward women's roles in _politics and leadership_ specifically did fall during those years.
Moreover, these patterns, if evidently fairly short-lived, were broadly shared across men and women, young and old, and those with more and less education (see Appendix D).

Did the election of women to the presidency or premiership provoke negative movements in macroegalitarianism in other countries?
Looking more broadly across the OECD allows us another opportunity to test the hypothesis that women chief executives, in contrast to the legislators we examined in Chapter 4, trigger public opinion backlash. 
Although women's successes in winning the chief executive's office remain decidedly the exception rather than the rule [see, e.g., @Barnes2025, 175], they have been growing more frequent over time across these countries.
Including Park, our dataset includes PGE scores during the time in office of 21 women leaders who governed in Korea and fourteen other OECD countries.
Trends in macroegalitarianism in these additional countries are depicted on the left side of @fig-pge_women_execs.^[
Israel, where Golda Meir was prime minister from 1969 to 1974, and Portugal, where Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo was prime minister from 1979 to 1980, are excluded from the figure because these terms in office predate our earliest PGE scores for those countries.
Because the PGE scores are measured at the annual level, Kim Campbell's four-month term as Canada's prime minister in 1993 and Anneli Jäätteenmäki's two months as Finland's prime minister in 2003 are too short to observe changes in this variable; these leaders' terms are excluded as well.
A number of additional OECD countries have elected women chief executives after the last year for which data on macroegalitarianism is currently available.
Regrettably, we cannot include these leaders in our analysis here either.]
The pale gray shading indicates the years during which a woman served as chief executive in each of these countries.

The right side of @fig-pge_women_execs shows how attitudes toward gender equality in the public sphere changed over the terms in office of women chief executives in the OECD for which we have PGE scores.
During these `r nrow(pge_diff)` terms in office, the change is estimated to be positive---that is, macroegalitarianism was higher at the end of the term than at its start---more than twice as often as it is negative (`r nrow(pge_diff %>% filter(diff > 0))` versus `r nrow(pge_diff %>% filter(diff < 0))` times).
Calculating the difference between two quantities measured with uncertainty results in even more uncertainty, however: only `r nrow(pge_diff %>% filter(diff_p10 > 0))` of these changes are credibly positive with 80% confidence.
On the other hand, the 80% credibility intervals indicate that none of the changes with negative point estimates are credibly different from zero. 
Taken as a whole, then, the evidence from the PGE scores across the OECD, like that for Korea, does not support the hypothesis that the mere election of a woman to a country's highest office works to trigger a backlash against gender equality in the public sphere among the members of the public.
Macroegalitarianism has increased during the terms in office of many women chief executives.

But as we saw in Korea during Park's presidency, the public's views on women in politics and positions of leadership may diverge from its general views on gender equality in the public sphere when a women serves as chief executive.
@fig-xc_polileader4 shows how mean disagreement with the statement "men make better political leaders than women" changed over time in the eleven countries for which these series intersected with the terms of women chief executives.
Although this is the survey item on gender equality in politics with the greatest overlap with women leaders, these data are very thin---recall that in Chapter 3, we explained that the sparsity of the existing data was an important motivation for creating the PGE scores.
Still, what data we have show very little evidence of declines in egalitarian views during the years in which women held office.^[
Among the surveys we used in Chapter 3 to generate the PGE scores, there are five other country-items asking about gender equality in politics that intersect with the time in office of women chief executives: three items of one country each, and a fourth with two countries.
All but one of these country-item series consist of just two time points, and the other has only three.
None of these five very short series exhibit discernibly declining levels of gender egalitarianism in the public during women's terms as chief executive.]

There is one exception: Michelle Bachelet's second term as president of Chile, 2014-2018.
Bachelet, a physician who also earned a graduate degree in military strategy, served first as Minister of Health and then Minister of Defense before being elected Chile's first woman president in 2005.
In her first term, from 2006 to 2010, Bachelet avoided scandal and achieved a number of policy successes, notably including the expansion of state childcare [see, e.g., @Reyes-Housholder2019].
Barred by law from serving consecutive terms, she ran and won again in Chile's late 2013 general elections and began her second term in 2014.
The average disagreement of Chileans with the statement that men make better political leaders than women fell by more than a tenth of the item's range after Bachelet's second election, returning to levels typical of the period before Bachelet's first term.

As in Korea, however, it appears this decline was short-lived.
@fig-xc_polileader4 also shows that in 2019, a year after Bachelet left office, average disagreement with this item had rebounded to a score indistinguishable from its previous high, reached the year before Bachelet was elected to the presidency for the second time.
Still, even these two episodes of apparent backlash, brief and limited though they may be, contradict the findings we presented earlier.


## Park's Presidency and Korean Public Opinion

A closer look at Park's presidency suggests a possible explanation: that women chief executives who are mired in scandal and policy failure change the public's views about women in politics and positions of power [cf. @Woo2025].
Park's economic policy disappointed many of her supporters.
Upon taking office, Park abandoned her campaign-trail promises to deliver economic democratization and a universal welfare state, pivoting instead to support for the 'creative economy' and further deregulation [see, e.g., @Kwon2017; @Choi2018; @Shin2018].
Hopes for a return to the spectacular economic growth of the Park Chung-hee era were similarly unfulfilled: GDP grew at annual rates of at most 3.2% during Park's presidency.

Most dramatically, Park's five-year term in office was cut short by the 'Choi Soon-sil Gate' scandal.
Choi Soon-sil is a long-time friend of Park Geun-hye and the daughter of the controversial cult leader, Choi Tae-min, who became a mentor to Park Geun-hye after her mother's death.
Even though Choi Soon-sil held no formal position within the government or the ruling party, the scandal revealed that she wielded astonishing influence over Park’s policy decisions, personnel appointments, and even her daily wardrobe.
Choi Soon-sil was found to have received drafts of confidential presidential speeches and documents and to have influenced high-level government decisions, personnel appointments, and state affairs without any legal authorization or security clearance.
This influence was widely viewed as a severe breach of constitutional order and a profound betrayal of public trust [@Kim2016].

The scandal began to unfold in mid-2016 with allegations concerning suspicious donations to two non-profit foundations, Mir and K-Sports, ostensibly dedicated to promoting Korean culture and sports [see, e.g., @Seo2021].
Investigative reporting by a conservative television station revealed that these organizations were fronts controlled by Choi Soon-sil [@Jhee2019, 579].
Park and Choi had both pressured Korean conglomerates to make contributions to these organizations [@Kim2016]; the straightforward details that Choi had leveraged her relationship with the president to gain her daughter acceptance at a prestigious university despite her mediocre high school grades and then later a more compliant academic advisor at that university gained the convoluted scandal continued public attention [@Seo2021].
In October 2016, other reporting disclosed the contents of a discarded tablet computer belonging to Choi Soon-sil and finally broke the public's trust irrevocably.
The device contained evidence that Choi Soon-sil had received and edited dozens of classified, sensitive state documents, including advance drafts of presidential speeches and state policy papers; Park's first public apology, delivered the following day, did nothing to quell public outrage [@Min2019, 7].

The public reaction was overwhelming.
Millions of South Koreans took to the streets bearing candles each Saturday evening to demand the president’s ouster [see, e.g., @Doucette2017; @Hwang2020; @Cho2021].
A special counsel investigation into Park was opened in November 2016, the National Assembly voted to impeach her that December, and with the massive protests in their twenty-third week, the Constitutional Court of South Korea unanimously upheld the impeachment in March 2017, citing Park’s gross abuse of power, her violation of her constitutional duty to protect the public’s life, and her actions that severely harmed the principles of representative democracy.

The Constitutional Court's ruling triggered a sequence of events.
Park had already been removed from office provisionally upon her impeachment, and this ruling ended her presidential term. 
She was subsequently arrested; indicted on eighteen criminal charges including bribery, coercion, and abuse of power; and then convicted and sentenced to a decades-long term in prison.
Additional trials added even more years to her sentence.^[
The presidential election was brought forward from December to May 2017, and the candidate of Korea's liberal Democratic Party, Moon Jae-in, won decisively against a fragmented field.
With Park's health failing after serving nearly five years in prison, Moon pardoned her near the end of his term [see, e.g., Shin2021].]
Park's time as Korea's first woman president unequivocally constituted a scandal-ridden failure.

What about Michelle Bachelet, the other woman president to see declines in public opinion toward women in politics?
Like Park's presidency, Bachelet's second term was marked by both policy failure and scandal.
During her second campaign, Bachelet proposed an ambitious reform agenda: to increase corporate taxes, to end Chile's market-oriented educational system, and to rewrite the constitution inherited from Chile's authoritarian regime [@Silva2016, 197].
Although she managed to quickly push through tax reforms, changes to the educational system were seen by many Chileans as falling short of the promised transformation of the sector [see @Torres2022, 156-157].
Bachelet's efforts to replace Chile's dictatorial constitution were severely constrained by the agreements that had provided the foundation for Chile's transition to democracy, and the process she outlined ultimately failed to gain the needed support in the legislature [see @Siavelis2016; @Garcia2024].

Moreover, just under a year after Bachelet retook office, and while she was away from the capital on vacation, scandal erupted.
The breaking story centered on a company half-owned by her daughter-in-law, which had struggled to complete a land deal.
Banks seemed unwilling to lend the needed funds, but on the day after her second election victory, a meeting with a Banco de Chile executive that her son attended finalized the required loan.
Just after the company completed the purchase, rezoning went into effect that permitted the parcels to be developed, and the land was quickly resold for a multi-million dollar profit [@Salaberry2015a; @Salaberry2015].
Bachelet was slow to respond to the story, but amid accusations of influence peddling and misuse of privileged information, she leaned on her reputation as an "honest mother"---an identity she had campaigned on---to express her concern while also proclaiming she had no knowledge of her son and daughter-in-law's actions.
Opposition politicians seized on the scandal to raise a series of heavily gendered criticisms: that Bachelet as a mother must have known about her son's presumed misdeeds and so was lying to the Chilean public, that by not insisting on her son's immediate resignation from his ceremonial position she put her role as mother ahead of her role as president, and that by crying over the matter in press conferences she acted without the rationality and strength the situation---and her office---demanded [see @Silva2016, 198-199; @Reyes-Housholder2020, 544-545].
The scandal and this discourse dogged Bachelet for the rest of her term.

These patterns suggest some support for the view that when a woman holds a country's chief executive office, her high visibility in what is among the most traditionally masculine domains _may_ trigger a distinctive negative response in gender egalitarian public opinion.
However, the case of Park in South Korea as well as that of Bachelet in Chile suggest that public opinion backlash is not triggered by women making "great strides," as @Faludi1991 [, xix] puts it. 
Rather than showing that the public lashes back against gender equality when women chief executives succeed, these cases instead indicate that it does so  only when they fail.


### Executive Failure, Public Approval, and Macroegalitarianism

To assess this possibility, we look to a crucial measure of leaders' success: executive public approval.
Public approval, it turns out, is a particularly good measure of the success of leaders who are women.
Scandals and policy failures have been found to have especially strong negative effects on the macro-approval of women presidents relative to men presidents [see, e.g., @Carlin2020; @Reyes-Housholder2020].
Specifically, we use the data provided by the Executive Approval Project [@Carlin2025], which combines "numerous disparate public opinion sources" that include various assessments "into a single unidimensional series capturing the public's view of the executive" in each country [@Carlin2020, 1366].

@fig-park_eap shows Park's net presidential approval---that is, the difference between her approval rating and her disapproval rating---for each month of her time in office.
Park, like most newly elected leaders, began her term with positive net approval; considerably more of the public approved than disapproved her performance during her first year in office.
However, her honeymoon with the public was clearly at an end with the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014 [@Son2021, 774].
That tragedy resulted in the loss of 304 lives. 
It also exposed the extent of regulatory capture that had persisted since the state corporatism of Park's father, Park Chung-hee [@You2017].
In August 2015, North and South Korea exchanged artillery and rocket fire across the demilitarized zone.
No casualties were reported, but this clash triggered a "rally &rsquo;round the flag" effect in Park's approval ratings [@Hur2023, 505; on these rally effects more generally, see @Mueller1970, 21-22] that briefly returned her net approval to positive territory.
By spring 2016, however, her net approval had fallen to its earlier deeply negative levels.
Then, in late October, with the revelations of the extent of Choi Soon-sil's involvement in government decision making, Park's net public approval fell off a cliff.
The widespread protests that followed evidenced the public's anger. 
By the time of her impeachment by the Korean National Assembly in December, Park's disapproval rate exceeded her approval rate by more than fifty points.
The tight relationship between Park's failures and declines in her public approval reinforces the view that public approval is a good measure of executive success.

@fig-eap_oecd shows the quarterly net public approval of the other women chief executives for whom data are available from the Executive Approval Project.
The panels are ordered by the average net approval for each executive.
The deeply negative approval ratings of Park's time in office and of Bachelet's second term are matched or exceeded by those of only three other women chief executives.
The trends in their public approval appear in the bottom row of the plot, along with those over Bachelet's two terms.

Do these very negative net approval ratings reflect poor performance on the part of these women in chief executive office?
In short, yes.
Public approval of Theresa May as prime minister of the United Kingdom comes closest to Park's disastrous ratings.
After the narrow victory of the Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum, May was charged with the unenviable responsibility of negotiating the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, a predicament memorably analogized as being tasked by a slender majority of the electorate to "build a submarine out of cheese" [@Rifkind2018].
With roughly half of the public opposed to the project from the start and the remainder unlikely to be satisfied with the necessarily shabby results, this inevitable policy failure pulled May's approval ratings under water for her entire time in office [see, e.g., @Byrne2021].^[
In the end May's successor, Boris Johnson, was only able to achieve his promise to 'get Brexit done' "by agreeing that Northern Ireland would continue to follow the EU’s rules and regulations on goods trade" and being "economical with the truth" [@Brusenbauch-Meislova2024, 275, 281]: in other words, by accepting that the Brexit cheese submarine would never actually be seaworthy and lying about it.]

Another woman chief executive to experience public approval in the same range as Park and Bachelet is Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica's center-right National Liberation Party.
Chinchilla was elected to the presidency in 2010 on a platform of fighting crime, raising taxes to lower the national debt, and completing several major infrastructure projects.
Numerous scandals---including Chinchilla repeatedly flying on planes owned by drug cartels; tax evasion among cabinet members, including the treasury minister; and corruption in contract awards---thwarted all of these policy goals [see @Hand2020, 121-125].
Her central campaign promise to dramatically expand state childcare also came to naught for insufficient funding, cementing perceptions of "widespread mismanagement and corruption within Chinchilla's administration" [@Hand2020, 125].

Finally, Margaret Thatcher's public approval ratings in her third term match the dismal record of Bachelet's second.
Thatcher famously pursued a series of policies that were deeply unpopular with much of the public of the United Kingdom over her three terms as prime minister; the combination of parliamentary government, legislative elections in single-member districts, and a divided opposition allowed her to pursue her expansive free-market agenda in the face of public disapproval despite the Conservative Party never winning more than 44% of the vote under her leadership [see, e.g., @Crewe1988; @Norpoth1992].
Although it is likely accurate that her consistently low public approval generally reflects her success in achieving goals the majority of the British public simply did not share, Thatcher's lowest public approval at the end of her premiership corresponded to her failure to forge a consensus position on Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism among her fellow Conservatives [see, e.g., @Matthijs2014, 94].
This same failure lost her the confidence of Parliament and saw her removed from office.

Conversely, @fig-eap_oecd also shows that women chief executives who avoid scandal and achieve policy successes are rewarded with high public approval.
New Zealand's Helen Clark and Jacinda Ardern, Norway's Erna Solberg, and Germany's Angela Merkel were all widely viewed as successful leaders during their years in office, and they maintained positive net public approval over their time as chief executives with brief if any exceptions.

Given then that public approval is a valid measure of the executive success, we can turn now to the question of whether the failures of women chief executives correspond to backlash against women in the public sphere.
Again with the caveat that the number of women chief executives in the OECD for which we have the necessary data do not allow for more sophisticated analyses of the sort we presented in prior chapters, the available evidence provides tentative support that they do.
The bivariate relationship between the change in PGE scores during a term of a woman chief executive and her mean net approval during that term is displayed in @fig-pge_eap.
Even with the large uncertainties in the change in PGE scores and the limited number of observations---the Executive Approval Project includes data on net approval for only `r nrow(pge_eap1)` terms of women chief executives who served at least two years in office---a positive relationship is evident.
High positive net approval ratings for women chief executives are associated with increases over their terms in the public's gender egalitarian attitudes.
Negative net approval ratings are associated with flat or perhaps declining levels of macroegalitarianism.
If gender egalitarian public opinion ever declines in response to a women chief executive, it would appear it does so in the rare instance of her failure, not on the more common occasion of her success.


## Korean Exceptionalism?

The turnabout between the election of Korea's first woman president in 2012 and the "incel election" of 2020 challenges the findings of positive public responsiveness to gender equality that we presented in previous chapters.
Is this turn of events paradigmatic of the manner in which the public lashes back against the movement toward gender equality constituted by the election of a woman to a country's highest political office?
Here, we have pushed the limits of the available data in search of evidence that contradicts our earlier conclusions.
There is little sign that macroegalitarianism---attitudes toward women in the public sphere generally---consistently declines when women hold chief executive office.
Indeed, the opposite is much more often the case.

We do find hints of support for a more limited and conditional argument based on the Korean experience: views on gender equality in politics and women in leadership may fall in the short run when women chief executives are implicated in scandal or suffer policy failure.
Higher rates of public approval are associated with larger increases in macroegalitarianism during the terms of women chief executives.
It would seem that public opinion does hold a woman's failure in high office against women in politics generally for as long as a few years before rebounding, though great caution is appropriate given this pattern is evinced in just a handful of observations beyond Korea: the second terms of Bachelet and May and the third of Thatcher.^[
Iveta Radičová's scandal-shortened two-year term as prime minister of Slovakia [see @Wolchik2017, 247]---during which the estimated decline in macroegalitarianism was the largest observed during any woman's term (see @fig-pge_women_execs)---likely fits the pattern as well, although the lack of executive approval data prevented its inclusion in the analysis presented in @fig-pge_eap.]
Chinchilla's scandal-wracked presidency of Costa Rica is a trenchant reminder on the latter point: despite her numerous policy failures and scandals and her subterranean levels of executive approval, the increase in macroegalitarianism during her term is estimated to have been greater than that for any other woman leader (see @fig-pge_women_execs). 
With relatively few woman chief executives and even fewer examples of their abject failure, the evidence for public opinion backlash against gender equality in the public sphere in even these circumstances cannot be considered conclusive.

The turnabout between the election of Park Geun-hye as Korea's first woman president and the election of an avowed opponent of efforts to advance gender equality, Yoon Suk-yeol, was dramatic.
But it was not necessarily a sign of a backlash against the success of women in the public sphere, the limited and conditional retrenchment in gender egalitarian public opinion we observe in this chapter notwithstanding.
Korea has some of the lowest levels of macroegalitarianism found in the OECD.
In fact, as @fig-pge_women_start shows, when Park became president, Korea had the lowest PGE score of any woman chief executive's country at the start of her term.
Park ran and won not so much as a woman candidate---an aspect of her candidacy that her campaign emphasized only in the final stretch before the election [@Lee2017]---but instead as a continuation of her father's political legacy, and the Korean public largely viewed her in that way [@Lee2023].
Although she gained votes among those who felt it was time for a woman president, her "political foundation was her partisan support" from conservative voters [@Hur2023, 501] and the strongest predictor of voting for Park was voters' feelings for her father and his record [@Kang2018].

It is not surprising, then, that Yoon's arguments against efforts to advance gender equality gained significant traction among much of the Korean public: demand for gender equality in Korea had been relatively low before Park's election and it remained relatively low after her impeachment.
What is in fact unusual about the Korean case is that, given public opinion toward women in the public sphere, a woman was able to win the country's highest political office at all.
Park, the 'princess of the nation' and the single woman with dynastic ties elected to chief executive office in the OECD, was likely the only woman able to achieve that feat.
