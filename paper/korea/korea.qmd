# Macroegalitarianism and Women as Chief Executives: The Case of South Korea

The perception that moves toward gender equality prompt backlashes in public opinion is, as we noted in our opening chapters, widespread.
Therefore, it would come as no surprise if there are, among those reading these pages, some who will find at least some of the conclusions of our two previous chapters on dynamic democracy too good to believe, in particular those regarding public responsiveness.
Recall that, across the countries of the OECD over several decades, we found evidence for not only democratic representation, politics and policy reflecting public opinion, but also _positive_ public responsiveness to politics and policy, that is, that public opinion responds to women's electoral success and the adoption of more gender egalitarian policies by growing _more_ egalitarian.
Such accelerating feedback is the exact opposite of what many observers fear is true.

Korea's recent political history seems to provide a strong basis for these fears that public opinion lashes back against women's successes in winning office and against other moves toward gender equality.
If public opinion backlash does not occur, how are we to understand events like Korea electing to its presidency Park Geun-hye, the country's first woman to hold that office, and then, just two elections later, choosing Yoon Seok-yeol, a man who built his political ascent around his anti-egalitarian views?
At least on its face, this sequence of events appears to contradict our conclusions.

In this chapter, we [dive deeper into the Korean case to take advantage of strengths of case studies]


> Justifications of case studies: theory generating. VanEvera1998; Gerring2004

> Justifications of doing a case study of _Korea_: a particularly challenging case for our conclusions/poorly explained by our model.  (outlier per VanEvera1998; deviant per Seawright2008)
Others?

> Hypotheses: i. Maybe woman _chief executives_ like Park are so much more visible that they trigger public opinion backlash?  We don't test this in Chapter 4.  ii. Maybe _bad_ chief executives trigger backlash?

## Park's Rise and Fall

The Park Geun-hye’s case in South Korea is one of the ideal cases to examine the influence of the performance of female political leaders on public opinion toward gender egalitarianism. Given that she was the first female president of South Korea, she has a symbolic significance related to gender stereotypes and gendered perceptions (Schwindt-Bayer & Reyes-Housholder, 2017). Moreover, the impeachment of Park Geun-hye makes the case of Park as a undisputable case of the failure of a female political leader (Woo et al., 2025).

Park Geun-hye’s trajectory in South Korean politics represents a profound case study in the intersection of dynastic legacy, democratic transition, and the abuse of executive power. Her rise to the presidency in 2013 was celebrated as a historical milestone—the nation’s first female head of state—yet her removal from office just four years later by a unanimous constitutional court ruling remains the most dramatic political scandal in modern South Korean history, demonstrating the robust power of its civil society and democratic institutions to purge corruption (Lee & Park, 2021; Turner et al., 2018).

Park Geun-hye is the eldest daughter of the former president Park Chung-hee (1963-1979) who was the military general who seized power in 1961 through May 16th Military Coup. Park Chung-hee has been evaluated as the dictator leading the era of rapid economic modernization, famously known as the “Miracle on the Han River” (Kim, 2004; Park, 2014). This family background of Park Geun-hye was the foundational political identity of Park. She has been regarded as a symbol of economic progress to her conservative party base, and a reminder of dictatorial oppression to supporters for the liberal political party (Lee, 2017).

After the First Lady Yuk Young-soo was assassinated in 1974, Park Geun-hye at the age of 22 during the Park Chung-hee took the role of acting First Lady until Park Chung-hee’s own assassination in 1979 (Lee, 2023). After her father's death and the process of the democratization of South Korea, Park retreated from the public eye for nearly two decades, maintaining an image of reclusive principle. Her political career began in 1998. She enters the National Assembly as a representative for the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) in a by-election for the Dalseong district of Daegu often referred to as the citadel of conservatism or the conservative heartland (Jung, 2021).
She was quickly recognized as a symbolic female political leader and establish a political persona centered on personal integrity and the virtue of keeping promises under the name of “trust politics” (Satake, 2025; Shin, 2020). She served twice as the party's chairwoman from 2004 to 2006. Also, it has been evaluated that she successfully navigated multiple crises and engineered improbable electoral victories, earning her the moniker “Queen of Elections” (Mun, 2015).

This reputation, combined with her father's enduring legacy among older, more conservative voters, propelled her to the forefront of national politics. In 2012, after spearheading the party's rebranding as the Saenuri Party (New Frontier Party), she secured the conservative presidential nomination and went on to win the 18th presidential election, becoming the first candidate since 1987 to win an outright majority of the popular vote (51.56%).
After her inauguration in February 2013, she sold her vision as a leader “married to the nation” and she aims to restore the high growth rates of her father's era. However, her presidency has been flawed along with Choi Soon-sil Scandal. Choi Soon-sil is the daughter of Park Geun-hye’s late mentor, Choi Tae-min who is the controversial pseudo-religious leader (Kim, 2016). Even though Choi Soon-sil held no formal position within the government or the ruling party, she was found to have wielded astonishing influence over the President’s policy decisions, personnel appointments, and even her daily wardrobe. For instance, Choi Soon-sil was found to have received drafts of confidential presidential speeches and documents, influencing high-level government decisions, personnel appointments, and state affairs without any legal authorization or security clearance. This was seen as a severe breach of constitutional order and a profound betrayal of public trust.

The scandal began to unfold in mid-2016 with allegations concerning suspicious donations to two non-profit foundations, Mir and K-sports, ostensibly dedicated to promoting Korean culture and sports. Investigative reporting revealed that these organizations were a front, allegedly controlled by Choi Soon-sil (Jhee & Park, 2019). The special counsel investigation targeting Park Geun-hye led by the former prosecutor Park Young-soo was started in November 2016. The investigation team operated for 90 days and unveiled the Choi Soon-sil Scandal. Especially, the revelation of a discarded tablet PC belonging to Choi Soon-sil broke the public trust irrevocably (Min & Yun, 2019). The device contained evidence that Choi Soon-sil had received and edited dozens of classified, sensitive state documents, including advance drafts of presidential speeches and state policy papers (Hwang & Willis, 2020).

The public reaction was immediate and overwhelming. Millions of South Koreans took to the streets in what became known as the “Candlelight Protests” and demand the President’s resignation (Cho & Hwang, 2021; Doucette, 2017). After the 23rd Candlelight Protest, the Constitutional Court of South Korea, on March 10, 2017, unanimously upheld the impeachment and cited Park’s gross abuse of power, her violation of her constitutional duty to protect the public’s life, and her actions that severely harmed the principles of representative democracy.

Removed from office immediately, Park was subsequently arrested, indicted on 18 criminal charges including bribery, coercion, and abuse of power, and later sentenced to a long term in prison (Schattle & Lee, 2019). Even though the impeachment of Park Geun-hye based on the role of civil society has been evaluated as an another advance of South Korea’s democracy, recent studies have revealed that the impeachment of Park Geun-hye negative affects public support toward female political leaders (Woo et al., 2025).

## Did Park's Election Trigger Backlash in Korean Public Opinion?

Did Park's success in winning the Blue House as Korea's first woman president cause a backlash in macroegalitarianism, public opinion toward gender equality in the public sphere?
@fig-koreapge plots the evolution of Korea's PGE scores before, during, and after Park's time in office.
The years during which Park held office are shaded in pale gray.
The PGE scores provide no clear evidence of a decline in gender egalitarian attitudes in Korea during these years.
When Park started her term in 2013, the country had a PGE score of 50.1 (80% credible interval: 46.2 to 52.2); when Park was removed from office in December 2016, Korea's PGE score was estimated to have _risen_ to 51.3 (80% c.i.: 48.1 to 54.5).

```{r pge}

But neither do these data show clear evidence of the _increase_ in macroegalitarianism that the cross-national results on women's legislative officeholding we presented in Chapter 4 would lead us to expect to occur during a time when the highest political office in the country was held by a woman. 
While estimated to be positive, the difference in PGE scores over these years---1.2 points---is not credibly different from zero (80% c.i.: -1.0 to 4.0).

We can dig even deeper, though.
One advantage of our focus on Korea in this chapter is that it facilitates looking at individual survey items in ways that are not possible when taking the broad comparative vantage that we adopt elsewhere in this book.
@fig-kd1allplot1 displays the trends of mean responses to the survey questions on gender egalitarianism that were used to create the PGE scores for Korea, with the items regarding equality in politics in the left column and those on equality in the workplace on the right.
The years that Park held the presidency, 2013--2016, are again shaded in pale gray.
Among the questions on equality in politics, all but one suggest a decline during Park's term; among the questions on equality in the workplace, all but one do _not_ evince a decline during those years---if anything, they typically show a drop before Park took office followed by a recovery during her term.

Before exploring further, it is worth pausing a moment to recall that this pattern is distinctly atypical.
Remember, we found in Chapter 3 that public opinion about equality in politics and in the workplace are typically tightly bound to each other (see, for example, @fig-pge_pwe_corr_plot).
That they are not in this case suggests that something unusual---and therefore interesting---is going on.

We also pause to note that the two exceptions appear upon closer examination to be perhaps not that exceptional.
With regard to political equality, the only item that intersects with Park's years in office that shows an increase is "in general, men and women make equally good political leaders."
The upswing in agreement with this item, however, is evidenced only in 2023, some seven years after Park was replaced in office and at least four years later than the last observations of the other political-equality items.^[
Indeed, the survey on which this observation is based, Pew Research Center's 2023 East Asian Societies Survey, was so much later that its release was too recent for it to be included in the PGE scores employed in this book.]
And with regard to equality in the workplace, the only item for which egalitarian responses declined over Park's term was "men make better business leaders than women," which is also the only workplace item that implicates women's leadership.
It would seem on the basis of this evidence that Park's presidency negatively affected the Korean public's views specifically of women _in politics and positions of power_, if only in the short run.

One additional point often raised by observers of Korean politics with regard to Park's presidency is that it ushered in a period of intense political polarization, a time in which the views of men and women, young and old, and those with more and less education moved in opposite directions.
If this is true, by looking at _average_ responses as we have, we may be overlooking additional signs of backlash against gender equality that are limited to particular Korean demographic groups and, within the entire public's opinion, counterbalanced by the views of other groups.
Appendix D breaks down the responses to the available survey items on gender equality in Korea by gender, generation, and education.
It shows that responses generally move similarly across these groups.
There are few signs of an increased polarization that worked to obscure backlash in gender egalitarianism in Korea.


## Have Women Leaders Triggered Public Opinion Backlash Elsewhere?

In the previous section, we found that the Korean public's general attitudes toward gender equality in the public sphere did not decline over Park's presidency, but that its views toward women's _leadership_ specifically did fall during those years.
Moreover, these patterns, if evidently fairly short-lived, were broadly shared across men and women, young and old, and those with more and less education.

Did the election of women to the presidency or premiership provoke negative movements in macroegalitarianism in other countries?
Looking more broadly across the OECD allows us another opportunity to test the hypothesis that women chief executives, in contrast to the legislators we examined in Chapter 4, trigger public opinion backlash. 
Although women's successes in winning the chief executive's office remain decidedly the exception rather than the rule, they have been growing more frequent over time across these countries.
Including Park, our dataset includes PGE scores during the time in office of 21 women leaders who governed in Korea and fourteen other OECD countries.
Trends in macroegalitarianism in these additional countries are depicted on the left side of @fig-pge_women_execs.^[
Israel, where Golda Meir was prime minister from 1969 to 1974, and Portugal, where Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo was prime minister from 1979 to 1980, are excluded from the figure because these terms in office predate our earliest PGE scores for those countries.
Because the PGE scores are measured at the annual level, Kim Campbell's four-month term as Canada's prime minister in 1993 and Anneli Jäätteenmäki's two months as Finland's prime minister in 2003 are too short to observe changes in this variable; these leaders' terms are excluded as well.
A number of additional OECD countries have elected women chief executives after the last year for which data on macroegalitarianism is currently available.
Regrettably, we cannot include these leaders in our analysis here either.]
The pale gray shading indicates the years during which a woman served as chief executive in each of these countries.

The right side of @fig-pge_women_execs shows how attitudes toward gender equality in the public sphere changed over the terms in office of women chief executives in the OECD for which we have PGE scores.
During these `r nrow(pge_diff)` terms in office, the change is estimated to be positive---that is, macroegalitarianism was higher at the end of the term than at its start---more than twice as often (`r nrow(pge_diff %>% filter(diff > 0))` times) as it is negative (`r nrow(pge_diff %>% filter(diff < 0))` times).
Calculating the difference between two quantities measured with uncertainty results in even more uncertainty, however: only `r nrow(pge_diff %>% filter(diff_p10 > 0))` of these changes are credibly positive with 80% confidence.
On the other hand, the 80% credibility intervals indicate that none of the changes with negative point estimates are credibly different from zero. 
Taken as a whole, then, the evidence from the PGE scores across the OECD, like that for Korea, does not support the hypothesis that the mere election of a woman to a country's highest office works to trigger a backlash against gender equality in the public sphere among the members of the public.
Macroegalitarianism has increased during the terms in office of many women chief executives.

But as we saw in Korea during Park's presidency, the public's views on women in politics and positions of leadership may diverge from its general views on gender equality in the public sphere when a women serves as chief executive.
@fig-xc_polileader4 shows how mean disagreement with the statement "men make better political leaders than women" changed over time in the eleven countries for which these series intersected with the terms of women chief executives.
Although this is the survey item on gender equality in politics with the greatest overlap with women leaders, these data are very thin---recall that in Chapter 3, we explained that the sparsity of the existing data was an important motivation for creating the PGE scores.
Still, what data we have show very little evidence of declines in egalitarian views during the years in which women held office.^[
Among the surveys we used in Chapter 3 to generate the PGE scores, there are five other country-items asking about gender equality in politics that intersect with the time in office of women chief executives: three items of one country each, and a fourth with two countries.
All but one of these country-item series consist of just two time points, and the other has only three.
None of these five very short series exhibit discernibly declining levels of gender egalitarianism in the public during women's terms as chief executive.]

There is one exception: Michelle Bachelet's second term as president of Chile, 2014-2018.
Bachelet, a physician who also earned a graduate degree in military strategy, served first as Minister of Health and then Minister of Defense before being elected Chile's first woman president in 2005.
In her first term, from 2006 to 2010, Bachelet avoided scandal and achieved a number of policy successes, notably including the expansion of state childcare [see, e.g., @Reyes-Housholder2019].
Barred by law from serving consecutive terms, she ran and won again in Chile's late 2013 general elections.
Just under a year after Bachelet took office, and while she was away from the capital on vacation, scandal erupted.
The breaking story centered on a company half-owned by her daughter-in-law, which had struggled to complete a land deal.
Banks seemed unwilling to lend the needed funds, but on the day after her election victory, a meeting with a Banco de Chile executive that her son attended finalized the required loan.
Just after the company completed the purchase, rezoning went into effect that permitted the parcels to be developed, and the land was quickly resold for a multi-million dollar profit [@Salaberry2015a; @Salaberry2015].
Bachelet was slow to respond to the story, but amid accusations of influence peddling and misuse of privileged information, she leaned on her reputation as an "honest mother"---an identity she had campaigned on---to express her concern while also proclaiming she had no knowledge of her son and daughter-in-law's actions.
Opposition politicians seized on the scandal to raise a series of heavily gendered criticisms: that Bachelet as a mother must have known about her son's presumed misdeeds and so was lying to the Chilean public, that by not insisting on her son's immediate resignation from his ceremonial position she put her role as mother ahead of her role as president, and that by crying over the matter in press conferences she acted without the rationality and strength the situation---and her office---demanded [see @Reyes-Housholder2020, 544-545].
The scandal and this discourse dogged Bachelet for the rest of her term.
They appear to have also influenced public opinion. 
The average disagreement of Chileans with the statement that men make better political leaders than women fell by more than a tenth of the item's range during these years, returning to levels typical of the period before Bachelet's first term.^[
As in Korea, however, the decline appears to have been short-lived.
@fig-xc_polileader4 also shows that in 2019, a year after Bachelet left office, average disagreement with this item had rebounded to a score indistinguishable from its previous high, reached the year before Bachelet was elected to the presidency for the second time.]



## Executive Approval

These patterns suggest some support for the view that when a woman holds a country's chief executive office, her high visibility in what is among the most traditionally masculine domains _may_ trigger a distinctive negative response in macroegalitarianism.
However, the case of Park in South Korea as well as that of Bachelet in Chile suggest that public opinion backlash is not triggered by women making "great strides," as @Faludi1991 [, xix] puts it. 
Rather than showing that the public lashes back against gender equality when women chief executives succeed, these cases instead indicate that it does so  when they fail.

To assess this possibility, we turn to executive public approval, a crucial measure of leaders' success.
Public approval, it turns out, is a particularly good measure of the success of leaders who are women: scandals and policy failures have been found to have especially strong negative effects on the macro-approval of women presidents relative to men presidents [see, e.g., @Carlin2020; @Reyes-Housholder2020].
Specifically, we use the data provided by the Executive Approval Project [@Carlin2025], which combines "numerous disparate public opinion sources" that include various assessments "into a single unidimensional series capturing the public's view of the executive" in each country [@Carlin2020, 1366].

@fig-park_eap shows Park's net presidential approval---that is, the difference between her approval rating and her disapproval rating---for each month of her time in office.
Park, like most newly elected leaders, began her term with positive net approval; considerably more of the public approved then disapproved during her first year in office.
Park's 'honeymoon' period was clearly at an end with the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014 [@Son2021, 774].
That tragedy resulted in the loss of 304 lives. 
It also exposed the extent of regulatory capture that had persisted since the state corporatism of Park's father, Park Chung-hee [@You2017].
In August 2015, North and South Korea exchanged artillery and rocket fire across the demilitarized zone.
No casualties were reported, but this clash triggered a "rally &rsquo;round the flag" effect in Park's approval ratings [@Hur2023, 505; on these rally effects more generally, see @Mueller1970, 21-22] that briefly returned her net approval to positive territory.
By spring 2016, however, her net approval had fallen to its earlier deeply negative levels.
Then, in late October, with the revelations of the extent of Choi Soon-sil's involvement in government decision making, Park's net public approval fell off a cliff.
The widespread protests that followed evidenced---and perhaps even deepened---the public's anger. 
By the time of her impeachment by the Korean National Assembly in December, Park's disapproval rate exceeded her approval rate by more than fifty points.

@fig-eap_oecd shows the quarterly net approval of the women chief executives for whom data are available from the Executive Approval Project.
The deeply negative approval ratings of Park's time in office and of Bachelet's second term are matched or exceeded by those of only three other women chief executives.
Two were prime ministers of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May.
Thatcher famously pursued a series of policies that were deeply unpopular with much of the public of the United Kingdom over three terms as prime minister; the combination of parliamentary government, legislative elections in single-member districts, and a divided opposition allowed her to pursue her expansive free-market agenda in the face of public disapproval despite her Conservative Party never winning more than 44% of the vote under her leadership [see, e.g., @Crewe1988; @Norpoth1992].
After the narrow victory of the Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum, May, also a Conservative, was charged with the unenviable responsibility of negotiating the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, a predicament memorably analogized as being tasked by a slender majority of the electorate to "build a submarine out of cheese" [@Rifkind2018].
With nearly half of the public opposed to the project from the start and the remainder unlikely to be satisfied with the inevitably shabby results, May's approval ratings for her entire time in office were predictably under water [see, e.g., @Byrne2021].^[
In the end May's successor, Boris Johnson, was only able to achieve his promise to 'get Brexit done' "by agreeing that Northern Ireland would continue to follow the EU’s rules and regulations on goods trade" and being "economical with the truth" [@Brusenbauch-Meislova2024, 275, 281]: in other words, by accepting that the Brexit cheese submarine would never actually be seaworthy and lying about it.]

The third woman chief executive to experience public approval as low as Park and Bachelet is Laura Chinchilla, of Costa Rica's center-right National Liberation Party.
Chinchilla was elected to the presidency in 2010 on a platform of fighting crime, raising taxes to lower the national debt, and complete major infrastructure projects.
Numerous scandals---including Chinchilla repeatedly flying on planes owned by drug cartels, tax evasion among by cabinet members, and corruption in contract awards---thwarted all of these policy goals [see @Hand2020, 121-125].
Her central campaign promise to dramatically expand childcare also came to naught for insufficient funding, cementing perceptions of "widespread mismanagement and corruption within Chinchilla's administration" [@Hand2020, 125].
With the exception of Thatcher, who succeeded in achieving goals the majority of the British public did not share, the low public approval of these women chief executives reflect the weight of policy failures and scandals.

The bivariate relationship between the change in PGE scores during a term of a woman chief executive and her mean net approval during that term is displayed in @fig-pge_eap.
Even with the large uncertainties in the change in PGE scores and the limited number of observations---the Executive Approval Project includes data on net approval for the terms of only `r nrow(pge_eap1)` women chief executives who served at least two years in office---a positive relationship is evident.
High positive net approval ratings for women chief executives are associated with increases over their terms in the public's gender egalitarian attitudes.
Negative net approval ratings are associated with flat or declining macroegalitarianism.

## Korean Exceptionalism?

Korea not exceptional in how the public reacted to a woman chief executive.
What is in fact unusual about the Korean case is that a woman held the country's highest politial office at all.
Korea has some of the lowest levels of macroegalitarianism in the OECD countries.
